# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the JPEG'd smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between April 7—April 13 2022.

## Wardens

66 Wardens contributed reports to the JPEG'd contest:

# High Risk Findings (9)
## [[H-01] yVault: First depositor can break minting of shares](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd-findings/issues/12)
_Submitted by hickuphh3, also found by 0xDjango, berndartmueller, cmichel, hyh, and WatchPug_

[yVault.sol#L148-L153](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd/blob/main/contracts/vaults/yVault/yVault.sol#L148-L153)<br>

The attack vector and impact is the same as [TOB-YEARN-003](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-security/blob/master/audits/20210719\_ToB_yearn_vaultsv2/ToB\_-\_Yearn_Vault_v\_2\_Smart_Contracts_Audit_Report.pdf), where users may not receive shares in exchange for their deposits if the total asset amount has been manipulated through a large “donation”.

### Proof of Concept

*   Attacker deposits 1 wei to mint 1 share
*   Attacker transfers exorbitant amount to the `StrategyPUSDConvex` contract to greatly inflate the share’s price. Note that the strategy deposits its entire balance into Convex when its `deposit()` function is called.
*   Subsequent depositors instead have to deposit an equivalent sum to avoid minting 0 shares. Otherwise, their deposits accrue to the attacker who holds the only share.

Insert this test into [`yVault.ts`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd/blob/main/tests/yVault.ts).

```jsx
it.only("will cause 0 share issuance", async () => {
  // mint 10k + 1 wei tokens to user1
  // mint 10k tokens to owner
  let depositAmount = units(10_000);
  await token.mint(user1.address, depositAmount.add(1));
  await token.mint(owner.address, depositAmount);
  // token approval to yVault
  await token.connect(user1).approve(yVault.address, 1);
  await token.connect(owner).approve(yVault.address, depositAmount);
  
  // 1. user1 mints 1 wei = 1 share
  await yVault.connect(user1).deposit(1);
  
  // 2. do huge transfer of 10k to strategy
  // to greatly inflate share price (1 share = 10k + 1 wei)
  await token.connect(user1).transfer(strategy.address, depositAmount);
  
  // 3. owner deposits 10k
  await yVault.connect(owner).deposit(depositAmount);
  // receives 0 shares in return
  expect(await yVault.balanceOf(owner.address)).to.equal(0);

  // user1 withdraws both his and owner's deposits
  // total amt: 20k + 1 wei
  await expect(() => yVault.connect(user1).withdrawAll())
    .to.changeTokenBalance(token, user1, depositAmount.mul(2).add(1));
});
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

*   [Uniswap V2 solved this problem by sending the first 1000 LP tokens to the zero address](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L119-L124). The same can be done in this case i.e. when `totalSupply() == 0`, send the first min liquidity LP tokens to the zero address to enable share dilution.
*   Ensure the number of shares to be minted is non-zero: `require(_shares != 0, "zero shares minted");`

## [[H-02] Existing user’s locked JPEG could be overwritten by new user, causing permanent loss of JPEG funds](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd-findings/issues/10)
_Submitted by hickuphh3, also found by 0x1f8b, AuditsAreUS, Foundation, Kthere, Meta0xNull, rayn, and WatchPug_

[NFTVault.sol#L375](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd/blob/main/contracts/vaults/NFTVault.sol#L375)<br>
[JPEGLock.sol#L54-L62](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd/blob/main/contracts/lock/JPEGLock.sol#L54-L62)<br>

A user’s JPEG lock schedule can be overwritten by another user’s if he (the other user) submits and finalizes a proposal to change the same NFT index’s value.

The existing user will be unable to withdraw his locked JPEGs, resulting in permanent lock up of JPEG in the locker contract.

### Proof of Concept

1.  `user` successfully proposes and finalizes a proposal to change his NFT’s collateral value
2.  Another user (`owner`) does the same for the same NFT index
3.  `user` will be unable to withdraw his locked JPEG because schedule has been overwritten

Insert this test case into [`NFTVault.ts`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd/blob/main/tests/NFTVault.ts).

```jsx
it.only("will overwrite existing user's JPEG lock schedule", async () => {
  // 0. setup
  const index = 7000;
  await erc721.mint(user.address, index);
  await nftVault
    .connect(dao)
    .setPendingNFTValueETH(index, units(50));
  await jpeg.transfer(user.address, units(150000));
  await jpeg.connect(user).approve(locker.address, units(500000));
  await jpeg.connect(owner).approve(locker.address, units(500000));

  // 1. user has JPEG locked for finalization
  await nftVault.connect(user).finalizePendingNFTValueETH(index);

  // 2. owner submit proposal to further increase NFT value
  await nftVault
    .connect(dao)
    .setPendingNFTValueETH(index, units(100));
  
  // 3. owner finalizes, has JPEG locked
  await nftVault.connect(owner).finalizePendingNFTValueETH(index);

  // user schedule has been overwritten
  let schedule = await locker.positions(index);
  expect(schedule.owner).to.equal(owner.address);

  // user tries to unstake
  // wont be able to because schedule was overwritten
  await timeTravel(days(366));
  await expect(locker.connect(user).unlock(index)).to.be.revertedWith("unauthorized");
});
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

1.  Release the tokens of the existing schedule. Simple and elegant.

```jsx
// in JPEGLock#lockFor()
LockPosition memory existingPosition = positions[_nftIndex];
if (existingPosition.owner != address(0)) {
  // release jpegs to existing owner
  jpeg.safeTransfer(existingPosition.owner, existingPosition.lockAmount);
}
```

2.  Revert in `finalizePendingNFTValueETH()` there is an existing lock schedule. This is less desirable IMO, as there is a use-case for increasing / decreasing the NFT value.

## [[H-03] Update initializer modifier to prevent reentrancy during initialization](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd-findings/issues/227)
_Submitted by Dravee_

[package.json#L18-L19](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd/blob/main/package.json#L18-L19)<br>

The solution uses:

```jsx
    "@openzeppelin/contracts": "^4.0.0",
    "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable": "^4.3.2",
```

These dependencies have a known high severity vulnerability:

*   <https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-OPENZEPPELINCONTRACTSUPGRADEABLE-2320177>
*   <https://snyk.io/test/npm/@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/4.3.2#SNYK-JS-OPENZEPPELINCONTRACTSUPGRADEABLE-2320177>
*   <https://snyk.io/test/npm/@openzeppelin/contracts/4.0.0#SNYK-JS-OPENZEPPELINCONTRACTS-2320176>

Which makes these contracts vulnerable:

```jsx
contracts/helpers/CryptoPunksHelper.sol:
  19:     function initialize(address punksAddress) external initializer {

contracts/helpers/EtherRocksHelper.sol:
  19:     function initialize(address rocksAddress) external initializer {

contracts/staking/JPEGStaking.sol:
  21:     function initialize(IERC20Upgradeable _jpeg) external initializer {

contracts/vaults/FungibleAssetVaultForDAO.sol:
  71:     ) external initializer {

contracts/vaults/NFTVault.sol:
  149:     ) external initializer {
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Upgrade `@openzeppelin/contracts` and `@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable` to version 4.4.1 or higher.

## [[H-04] Reentrancy issue in `yVault.deposit`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd-findings/issues/81)
_Submitted by cmichel_

[yVault.sol#L144-L145](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd/blob/e72861a9ccb707ced9015166fbded5c97c6991b6/contracts/vaults/yVault/yVault.sol#L144-L145)<br>

In `deposit`, the balance is cached and then a `token.transferFrom` is triggered which can lead to exploits if the `token` is a token that gives control to the sender, like ERC777 tokens.

### Proof of Concept

Initial state: `balance() = 1000`, shares `supply = 1000`.
Depositing 1000 amount should mint 1000 supply, but one can split the 1000 amounts into two 500 deposits and use re-entrancy to profit.

*   Outer `deposit(500)`: `balanceBefore = 1000`. Control is given to attacker ...
*   Inner `deposit(500)`: `balanceBefore = 1000`. `shares = (_amount * supply) / balanceBefore = 500 * 1000 / 1000 = 500` shares are minted ...
*   Outer `deposit(500)` continues with the mint: `shares = (_amount * supply) / balanceBefore = 500 * 1500 / 1000 = 750` are minted.
*   Withdrawing the `500 + 750 = 1250` shares via `withdraw(1250)`, the attacker receives `backingTokens = (balance() * _shares) / supply = 2000 * 1250 / 2250 = 1111.111111111`. The attacker makes a profit of `1111 - 1000 = 111` tokens.
*   They repeat the attack until the vault is drained.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The `safeTransferFrom` should be the last call in `deposit`.

## [[H-05] `yVaultLPFarming`: No guarantee JPEG currentBalance > previousBalance](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd-findings/issues/56)
_Submitted by hickuphh3_

[yVaultLPFarming.sol#L169-L170](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd/blob/main/contracts/farming/yVaultLPFarming.sol#L169-L170)<br>

yVault users participating in the farm have to trust that:

*   `vault.balanceOfJPEG()`  returns the correct claimable JPEG amount by its strategy / strategies
*   the strategy / strategies will send all claimable JPEG to the farm

Should either of these assumptions break, then it could possibly be the case that `currentBalance` is less than `previousBalance`, causing deposits and crucially, withdrawals to fail due to subtraction overflow.

### Proof of Concept

For instance,

*   Farm migration occurs. A new farm is set in `yVault`, then `withdrawJPEG()` is called, which sends funds to the new farm. Users of the old farm would be unable to withdraw their deposits.

```jsx
it.only("will revert old farms' deposits and withdrawals if yVault migrates farm", async () => {
  // 0. setup
  await token.mint(owner.address, units(1000));
  await token.approve(yVault.address, units(1000));
  await yVault.depositAll();
  await yVault.approve(lpFarming.address, units(1000));
  // send some JPEG to strategy prior to deposit
  await jpeg.mint(strategy.address, units(100));
  // deposit twice, so that the second deposit will invoke _update()
  await lpFarming.deposit(units(250));
  await lpFarming.deposit(units(250));
	
  // 1. change farm and call withdrawJPEG()
  await yVault.setFarmingPool(user1.address);
  await yVault.withdrawJPEG();
	
  // deposit and withdrawal will fail
  await expect(lpFarming.deposit(units(500))).to.be.revertedWith('reverted with panic code 0x11 (Arithmetic operation underflowed or overflowed outside of an unchecked block)');
  await expect(lpFarming.withdraw(units(500))).to.be.revertedWith('reverted with panic code 0x11 (Arithmetic operation underflowed or overflowed outside of an unchecked block)');
});
```

*   Strategy migration occurs, but JPEG funds held by the old strategy were not claimed, causing `vault.balanceOfJPEG()` to report a smaller amount than previously recorded
*   `jpeg` could be accidentally included in the StrategyConfig, resulting in JPEG being converted to other assets
*   A future implementation takes a fee on the `jpeg` to be claimed

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

A simple fix would be to `return` if `currentBalance ≤ previousBalance`. A full fix would properly handle potential shortfall.

```jsx
if (currentBalance <= previousBalance) return;
```

## [[H-06] Setting new controller can break `YVaultLPFarming`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd-findings/issues/80)
_Submitted by cmichel_

[yVaultLPFarming.sol#L170](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd/blob/e72861a9ccb707ced9015166fbded5c97c6991b6/contracts/farming/yVaultLPFarming.sol#L170)<br>
[yVault.sol#L108](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd/blob/e72861a9ccb707ced9015166fbded5c97c6991b6/contracts/vaults/yVault/yVault.sol#L108)<br>

The accruals in `yVaultLPFarming` will fail if [`currentBalance < previousBalance`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd/blob/e72861a9ccb707ced9015166fbded5c97c6991b6/contracts/farming/yVaultLPFarming.sol#L170) in `_computeUpdate`.

```solidity
currentBalance = vault.balanceOfJPEG() + jpeg.balanceOf(address(this));
uint256 newRewards = currentBalance - previousBalance;
```

No funds can be withdrawn anymore as the `withdraw` functions first trigger an `_update`.

The `currentBalance < previousBalance` case can, for example, be triggerd by decreasing the `vault.balanceOfJPEG()` due to calling `yVault.setController`:

```solidity
function setController(address _controller) public onlyOwner {
    // @audit can reduce balanceofJpeg which breaks other masterchef contract
    require(_controller != address(0), "INVALID_CONTROLLER");
    controller = IController(_controller);
}

function balanceOfJPEG() external view returns (uint256) {
    // @audit new controller could return a smaller balance
    return controller.balanceOfJPEG(address(token));
}
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Setting a new controller on a vault must be done very carefully and requires a migration.

## [[H-07] Controller: Strategy migration will fail](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd-findings/issues/57)
_Submitted by hickuphh3, also found by rayn_

[Controller.sol#L95](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd/blob/main/contracts/vaults/yVault/Controller.sol#L95)<br>
[StrategyPUSDConvex.sol#L266](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd/blob/main/contracts/vaults/yVault/strategies/StrategyPUSDConvex.sol#L266)<br>

The controller calls the `withdraw()` method to withdraw JPEGs from the contract, but the strategy might blacklist the JPEG asset, which is what the PUSDConvex strategy has done.

The migration would therefore revert.

### Proof of Concept

Insert this test into [`StrategyPUSDConvex.ts`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd/blob/main/tests/StrategyPUSDConvex.ts).

```jsx
it.only("will revert when attempting to migrate strategy", async () => {
  await controller.setVault(want.address, yVault.address);
  await expect(controller.setStrategy(want.address, strategy.address)).to.be.revertedWith("jpeg");
});
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Replace `_current.withdraw(address(jpeg));` with `_current.withdrawJPEG(vaults[_token])`.

## [[H-08] `StrategyPUSDConvex.balanceOfJPEG` uses incorrect function signature while calling `extraReward.earned`, causing the function to unexpectedly revert everytime](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd-findings/issues/139)
_Submitted by rayn_

[StrategyPUSDConvex.sol#L234](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd/blob/main/contracts/vaults/yVault/strategies/StrategyPUSDConvex.sol#L234)<br>

As specified in Convex [BaseRewardPool.sol](https://github.com/convex-eth/platform/blob/main/contracts/contracts/BaseRewardPool.sol#L149) and [VirtualRewardPool.sol](https://github.com/convex-eth/platform/blob/main/contracts/contracts/VirtualBalanceRewardPool.sol#L127), the function signature of `earned` is `earned(address)`. However, `balanceOfJPEG` did not pass any arguments to `earned`, which would cause `balanceOfJPEG` to always revert.

This bug will propagate through `Controller` and `YVault` until finally reaching the source of the call in `YVaultLPFarming ._computeUpdate`, and render the entire farming contract unuseable.

### Proof of Concept

Both `BaseRewardPool.earned` and `VirtualBalanceRewardPool.earned` takes an address as argument

        function earned(address account) public view returns (uint256) {
            return
                balanceOf(account)
                    .mul(rewardPerToken().sub(userRewardPerTokenPaid[account]))
                    .div(1e18)
                    .add(rewards[account]);
        }

        function earned(address account) public view returns (uint256) {
            return
                balanceOf(account)
                    .mul(rewardPerToken().sub(userRewardPerTokenPaid[account]))
                    .div(1e18)
                    .add(rewards[account]);
        }

But `balanceOfJPEG` does not pass any address to `extraReward.earned`, causing the entire function to revert when called

        function balanceOfJPEG() external view returns (uint256) {
            uint256 availableBalance = jpeg.balanceOf(address(this));

            IBaseRewardPool baseRewardPool = convexConfig.baseRewardPool;
            uint256 length = baseRewardPool.extraRewardsLength();
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) {
                IBaseRewardPool extraReward = IBaseRewardPool(baseRewardPool.extraRewards(i));
                if (address(jpeg) == extraReward.rewardToken()) {
                    availableBalance += extraReward.earned();
                    //we found jpeg, no need to continue the loop
                    break;
                }
            }

            return availableBalance;
        }

### Tools Used

vim, ganache-cli

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Pass `address(this)` as argument of `earned`.

Notice how we modify the fetching of reward. This is reported in a separate bug report, but for completeness, the entire fix is shown in both report entries.

        function balanceOfJPEG() external view returns (uint256) {
            uint256 availableBalance = jpeg.balanceOf(address(this));

            IBaseRewardPool baseRewardPool = convexConfig.baseRewardPool;
            availableBalance += baseRewardPool.earned(address(this));
            uint256 length = baseRewardPool.extraRewardsLength();
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) {
                IBaseRewardPool extraReward = IBaseRewardPool(baseRewardPool.extraRewards(i));
                if (address(jpeg) == extraReward.rewardToken()) {
                    availableBalance += extraReward.earned(address(this));
                }
            }

            return availableBalance;
        }

## [[H-09] Bad debts should not continue to accrue interest](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd-findings/issues/167)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

[NFTVault.sol#L844-L851](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd/blob/e72861a9ccb707ced9015166fbded5c97c6991b6/contracts/vaults/NFTVault.sol#L844-L851)<br>

```solidity
uint256 debtAmount = _getDebtAmount(_nftIndex);
require(
    debtAmount >= _getLiquidationLimit(_nftIndex),
    "position_not_liquidatable"
);

// burn all payment
stablecoin.burnFrom(msg.sender, debtAmount);
```

In the current design/implementation, the liquidator must fully repay the user's outstanding debt in order to get the NFT.

When the market value of the NFT fell rapidly, the liquidators may not be able to successfully liquidate as they can not sell the NFT for more than the debt amount.

In that case, the protocol will have positions that are considered bad debts.

However, these loans, which may never be repaid, are still accruing interest. And every time the DAO collects interest, new `stablecoin` will be minted.

When the proportion of bad debts is large enough since the interest generated by these bad debts is not backed. It will damage the authenticity of the stablecoin.

### Proof of Concept

Given:

*   `NFT 1` worth 30,000 USD
*   `creditLimitRate` = 60%
*   `liquidationLimitRate` = 50%
*   `debtInterestApr` = 10%

1.  Alice borrowed `10,000 USD` with `NFT #1`;
2.  After 1 year, `NFT 1`'s market value in USD has suddenly dropped to `10,000` USD, no liquidator is willing to repay 11,000 USD for `NFT #1`;
3.  The DAO `collect()` and minted `1,000` stablecoin;
4.  After 1 year, the DAO call `collect()` will mint `1,100` stablecoin. and so on...

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider adding a stored value to record the amount of bad debt, and add a public function that allows anyone to mark a bad debt to get some reward. and change `accrue` to:

```solidity
uint256 internal badDebtPortion;

function accrue() public {
    uint256 additionalInterest = _calculateAdditionalInterest();

    totalDebtAccruedAt = block.timestamp;

    totalDebtAmount += additionalInterest;

    uint256 collectibleInterest = additionalInterest * (totalDebtPortion - badDebtPortion) / totalDebtPortion;
    totalFeeCollected += collectibleInterest;
}
```

# Medium Risk Findings (11)
## [[M-01] When _lpToken is jpeg, reward calculation is incorrect](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd-findings/issues/1)
_Submitted by cccz, also found by minhquanym_

In the LPFarming contract, a new staking pool can be added using the add() function. The staking token for the new pool is defined using the \_lpToken variable. However, there is no additional checking whether the \_lpToken is the same as the reward token (jpeg) or not.

        function add(uint256 _allocPoint, IERC20 _lpToken) external onlyOwner {
            _massUpdatePools();

            uint256 lastRewardBlock = _blockNumber();
            totalAllocPoint = totalAllocPoint + _allocPoint;
            poolInfo.push(
                PoolInfo({
                    lpToken: _lpToken,
                    allocPoint: _allocPoint,
                    lastRewardBlock: lastRewardBlock,
                    accRewardPerShare: 0
                })
            );
        }

When the \_lpToken is the same token as jpeg, reward calculation for that pool in the updatePool() function can be incorrect. This is because the current balance of the \_lpToken in the contract is used in the calculation of the reward. Since the \_lpToken is the same token as the reward, the reward minted to the contract will inflate the value of lpSupply, causing the reward of that pool to be less than what it should be.

        function _updatePool(uint256 _pid) internal {
            PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
            if (pool.allocPoint == 0) {
                return;
            }

            uint256 blockNumber = _blockNumber();
            //normalizing the pool's `lastRewardBlock` ensures that no rewards are distributed by staking outside of an epoch
            uint256 lastRewardBlock = _normalizeBlockNumber(pool.lastRewardBlock);
            if (blockNumber <= lastRewardBlock) {
                return;
            }
            uint256 lpSupply = pool.lpToken.balanceOf(address(this));
            if (lpSupply == 0) {
                pool.lastRewardBlock = blockNumber;
                return;
            }
            uint256 reward = ((blockNumber - lastRewardBlock) *
                epoch.rewardPerBlock *
                1e36 *
                pool.allocPoint) / totalAllocPoint;
            pool.accRewardPerShare = pool.accRewardPerShare + reward / lpSupply;
            pool.lastRewardBlock = blockNumber;
        }

### Proof of Concept

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a check that \_lpToken is not jpeg in the add function or mint the reward token to another contract to prevent the amount of the staked token from being mixed up with the reward token.

## [[M-02] NFTHelper Contract Allows Owner to Burn NFTs](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd-findings/issues/47)
_Submitted by Kenshin_

[CryptoPunksHelper.sol#L38](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd/blob/e72861a9ccb707ced9015166fbded5c97c6991b6/contracts/helpers/CryptoPunksHelper.sol#L38)<br>
[CryptoPunksHelper.sol#L52](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd/blob/e72861a9ccb707ced9015166fbded5c97c6991b6/contracts/helpers/CryptoPunksHelper.sol#L52)<br>

In the NFT helper contract, there is no validation on that the receiver address must not be address zero. Therefore, it allows owner or an attacker who gain access to the owner address to burn NFTs forever through the functions by transferring the NFTs to address zero.

### Proof of Concept

The PoC is originally conducted using foundry. However, it isn't that complicated so I rewrote it in TypeScipt as well, the team can easily proof this by including in the `CryptoPunksHelper.ts`.

#### TypeScript

    // add `.only` to run only this test, not all.
    it.only("allows the owner to burn nfts", async () => {
        // safeTransferFrom
        await cryptoPunks.getPunk(1);
        await cryptoPunks.transferPunk(helper.address, 1);
        await helper.safeTransferFrom(owner.address, ZERO_ADDRESS, 1);
        expect(await cryptoPunks.punkIndexToAddress(1)).to.equal(ZERO_ADDRESS);
        expect(await helper.ownerOf(1)).to.equal(ZERO_ADDRESS);

        // transferFrom
        await cryptoPunks.getPunk(2);
        await cryptoPunks.transferPunk(helper.address, 2);
        await helper.transferFrom(owner.address, ZERO_ADDRESS, 2);
        expect(await cryptoPunks.punkIndexToAddress(2)).to.equal(ZERO_ADDRESS);
        expect(await helper.ownerOf(2)).to.equal(ZERO_ADDRESS);
      });

#### Foundry

    pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

    // for test
    import "ds-test/test.sol";
    import "forge-std/Vm.sol";

    // contracts
    import "../test/CryptoPunks.sol";
    import "../helpers/CryptoPunksHelper.sol";

    contract CryptoPunksHelperTest is DSTest {
        Vm constant vm = Vm(HEVM_ADDRESS);
        
        address owner = address(1);
        address user = address(2);
        
        CryptoPunks private cps;
        CryptoPunksHelper private helper;

        function setUp() public {
            vm.startPrank(owner);
            cps = new CryptoPunks();
            helper = new CryptoPunksHelper();
            helper.initialize(address(cps));
            vm.stopPrank();
        }

        function testOwnerTransferToZero() public {
            //make sure address zero hold no punks
            assertEq(cps.balanceOf(address(0)), 0);

            // safeTransferFrom PoC
            vm.startPrank(owner);
            cps.getPunk(1);
            cps.transferPunk(address(helper), 1);
            helper.safeTransferFrom(owner, address(0), 1);
            assertEq(cps.punkIndexToAddress(1), address(0));
            assertEq(helper.ownerOf(1), address(0));
            assertEq(cps.balanceOf(address(0)), 1);

            // transferFrom PoC
            cps.getPunk(2);
            cps.transferPunk(address(helper), 2);
            helper.transferFrom(owner, address(0), 2);
            assertEq(cps.punkIndexToAddress(2), address(0));
            assertEq(helper.ownerOf(2), address(0));
            assertEq(cps.balanceOf(address(0)), 2);
        }
    }

foundry.toml

    [default]
    src = "contracts"
    libs = ["lib/forge-std/lib", "lib/", "node_modules"]
    solc_version = "0.8.0"
    optimizer = false
    fuzz_runs = 100000
    test = "foundryTest"

### Tools Used

*   Foundry
*   Hardhat

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Even the functions are restricted for only the owner, the zero address should not be allowed as the receiver address.

## [[M-03] reward will be locked in the farm if no LP join the pool at epoch.startBlock ](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd-findings/issues/14)
_Submitted by TrungOre_

[LPFarming.sol#L214](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd/blob/e72861a9ccb707ced9015166fbded5c97c6991b6/contracts/farming/LPFarming.sol#L214)<br>

A part of reward tokens will be locked in the farming pool if no user deposits lpToken at the epoch.startBlock.

### Proof of Concept

    it("a part of reward should be locked in farm if no LP join the pool at epoch.startBlock", async() => {
          // manual mine new block  
          await network.provider.send("evm_setAutomine", [false]);

          // prepare 
          await lpTokens[0].transfer(alice.address, units(1000));
          await lpTokens[0].connect(alice).approve(farming.address, units(1000));
          await mineBlocks(1);

          // create new pool
          await farming.add(10, lpTokens[0].address);
          await mineBlocks(1);
          expect(await farming.poolLength()).to.equal(1);

          let pool = await farming.poolInfo(0);
          expect(pool.lpToken).to.equal(lpTokens[0].address);
          expect(pool.allocPoint).to.equal(10);

          // create new epoch ==> balance of pool will be 1000 
          let blockNumber = await ethers.provider.getBlockNumber();
          await farming.newEpoch(blockNumber + 1, blockNumber + 11, 100);

          // skip the epoch.startBlock  
          // it mean no one deposit lpToken to farm at this block 
          await mineBlocks(1);
          expect(await jpeg.balanceOf(farming.address)).to.equal(1000);

          // alice deposit 
          await farming.connect(alice).deposit(0, units(100));
          await mineBlocks(1);

          // skip the blocks to the end of epoch 
          await mineBlocks(13);

          await farming.connect(alice).claim(0);
          await mineBlocks(1);

          console.log("reward of alice: ", (await jpeg.balanceOf(alice.address)).toString());
          console.log("reward remain: ", await jpeg.balanceOf(farming.address));

          // 100 jpeg will be locked in the pool forevers 
          expect(await jpeg.balanceOf(alice.address)).to.equal(900);
          expect(await jpeg.balanceOf(farming.address)).to.equal(100);
        }); 

In the example above, I create an epoch from blockNumber + 1 to blockNumber + 11 with the reward for each block being 100JPEG. So, the total reward for this farm will be 1000JPEG. When I skip the epoch.startBlock and let Alice deposit 100 lpToken at the block right after, at the end of the farm (epoch.endBlock), the total reward of Alice is just 900JPEG, and 100JPEG still remains in the farming pool. Since there is no function for the admin (or users) to withdraw the remaining, 100JPEG will be stucked in the pool forever !!!

### Tools Used

typescript

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a new function for the admin (or user) to claim all rewards which remained in the pool when epoch.endTime has passed

    function claimRemainRewardsForOwner() external onlyOwner {
            require(
                block.number > epoch.endBlock, 
                'epoch has not ended'
            );
            uint256 remain = jpeg.balanceOf(address(this));
            jpeg.safeTransfer(msg.sender, remain);
        }

_Submitted by cmichel, also found by pedroais_

The `setDebtInterestApr` changes the debt interest rate without first accruing the debt.<br>
This means that the new debt interest rate is applied retroactively to the unaccrued period on next `accrue()` call.

It should never be applied retroactively to a previous time window as this is unfair & wrong.<br>
Borrowers can incur more debt than they should.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Call `accrue()` first in `setDebtInterestApr` before setting the new `settings.debtInterestApr`.

          console.log("reward of alice: ", (await   farming.pendingReward(0, alice.address)).toString());
          expect(await farming.pendingReward(0, alice.address)).to.equal(BigNumber.from('500'));
        });

In the test above, the attacker transfers 100 lpToken to the farm without using deposit function, and alice deposit 100 lpToken. Because the contract uses `pool.lpToken.balanceOf(address(this))` to get the total supply of lpToken in the pool, it will sum up 100 lpToken of attacker and 100 lpToken of alice. This will lead to the situation where Alice will only be able to claim 500 token (at epoch.endBlock), the rest will be locked in the pool forever. Not only with this pool, it also affects the following, a part of the reward will be locked in the pool when the farm end.

### Tools Used

typescript

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Declare a new variable `totalLPSupply` to the struct `PoolInfo`, and use it instead of `pool.lpToken.balanceOf(address(this))`.

## [[M-06] Oracle data feed is insufficiently validated.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd-findings/issues/54)
_Submitted by Jujic, also found by hickuphh3_

Price can be stale and can lead to wrong `answer` return value.

### Proof of Concept

Oracle data feed is insufficiently validated. There is no check for stale price and round completeness. Price can be stale and can lead to wrong  `answer`  return value.

```
function _collateralPriceUsd() internal view returns (uint256) {
        int256 answer = oracle.latestAnswer();
        uint8 decimals = oracle.decimals();

        require(answer > 0, "invalid_oracle_answer");

        ...

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Validate data feed

```
function _collateralPriceUsd() internal view returns (uint256) {

(uint80 roundID, int256 answer, , uint256 timestamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = oracle.latestRoundData();
   
    require(answer > 0, "invalid_oracle_answer");
    require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "ChainLink: Stale price");

## [[M-07] Wrong calculation for `yVault` price per share if decimals != 18](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd-findings/issues/117)
_Submitted by berndartmueller_

The [yVault.getPricePerFullShare()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd/blob/main/contracts/vaults/yVault/yVault.sol#L196) function calculates the price per share by multiplying with `1e18` token decimals with the assumption that the underlying token always has 18 decimals. `yVault` has the same amount of decimals as it's underlying token see ([yVault.decimals()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd/blob/main/contracts/vaults/yVault/yVault.sol#L70))

But tokens don't always have `1e18` decimals (e.g. USDC).

### Impact

The price per share calculation does not return the correct price for underlying tokens that do not have 18 decimals. This could lead to paying out too little or too much and therefore to a loss for either the protocol or the user.

### Proof of Concept

Following test will fail with the current implementation when the underlying vault token has 6 decimals:

*NOTE: `units()` helper function was adapted to accept the desired decimals.*

```typescript
it.only("should mint the correct amount of tokens for tokens with 6 decimals", async () => {
  const DECIMALS = 6;

  await token.setDecimals(DECIMALS);
  expect(await yVault.decimals()).to.equal(DECIMALS);

  expect(await yVault.getPricePerFullShare()).to.equal(0);
  await token.mint(user1.address, units(1000, DECIMALS));
  await token.connect(user1).approve(yVault.address, units(1000, DECIMALS));

  await yVault.connect(user1).deposit(units(500, DECIMALS));
  expect(await yVault.balanceOf(user1.address)).to.equal(units(500, DECIMALS));

  await token.mint(strategy.address, units(500, DECIMALS));
  expect(await yVault.getPricePerFullShare()).to.equal(units(2, DECIMALS));
});
```

Fails with following error: `AssertionError: Expected "2000000000000000000" to be equal 2000000`

### Recommended mitigation steps

Use vault `decimals()` instead of hardcoded `1e18` decimals.

```solidity
function getPricePerFullShare() external view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 supply = totalSupply();
    if (supply == 0) return 0;
    return (balance() * (10**decimals())) / supply; // @audit-info use `decimals()` instead of hardcoded `1e18`
}
```

        minOut,
        path,
        address(this),
        block.timestamp
    );
}
```

In the current implementation, `rewardTokens` from the underlying strategy will be swapped to `weth` first then `weth` -> `usdc`.

However, the `path` used for swapping from `rewardToken` -> `weth` is hardcoded as `[rewardToken, weth]`, which may not be the optimal route.

For example, the majority liquidity for a particular `rewardToken` may actually be in the `rewardToken/USDC` pool. Swapping through the `rewardToken/WETH` with low liquidity may end up getting only a dust amount of WETH.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider allowing the admin to set a path for the rewardTokens.

_Submitted by Wayne, also found by hyh, PPrieditis, rayn, smiling_heretic, and Cr4ckM3_

The expectation of the noContract modifier is to allow access only to accounts inside EOA or Whitelist, if access is controlled using ! access control with \_account.isContract(), then because isContract() gets the size of the code length of the account in question by relying on extcodesize/address.code.length, this means that the restriction can be bypassed when deploying a smart contract through the smart contract's constructor call.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Modify the code to `require(msg.sender == tx.origin);`

## [[M-11] Division before Multiplication May Result In No Interest Being Accrued](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd-findings/issues/97)
_Submitted by AuditsAreUS, also found by minhquanym_

[NFTVault.sol#L590-L595](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-jpegd/blob/e72861a9ccb707ced9015166fbded5c97c6991b6/contracts/vaults/NFTVault.sol#L590-L595)<br>

There is a division before multiplication bug in `NFTVault._calculateAdditionalInterest()` which may result in no interesting being accrued and will have significant rounding issues for tokens with small decimal places.

This issue occurs since an intermediate calculation of  `interestPerSec` may round to zero and therefore the multiplication by `elapsedTime` may remain zero.

Furthermore, even if `interestPerSec > 0` there will still be rounding errors as a result of doing division before multiplication and `_calculatedInterest()` will be understated.

This issue is significant as one divisor is 365 days = 30,758,400 (excluding the rate). Since many ERC20 tokens such as USDC and USDT only have 6 decimal places a numerator of less 30 \* 10^6 will round to zero.

The rate also multiplies into the denominator. e.g. If the rate is 1% then the denominator will be equivalent to `1 / rate * 30 * 10^6 = 3,000 * 10^6`.

### Proof of Concept

The order of operations for the interest calculations

*   `totalDebtAmount`
*   MUL `settings.debtInterestApr.numerator`
*   DIV `settings.debtInterestApr.denominator`
*   DIV `365 days`
*   MUL `elapsedTime`

If the intermediate value of `interestPerSec = 0` then the multiplication by `elapsedTime` will still be zero and no interested will be accrued.

Excerpt from `NFTVault._calculateAdditionalInterest()`.

            uint256 interestPerYear = (totalDebtAmount *
                settings.debtInterestApr.numerator) /
                settings.debtInterestApr.denominator;
            uint256 interestPerSec = interestPerYear / 365 days;

            return elapsedTime * interestPerSec;

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

This issue may be resolved by performing the multiplication by `elapsedTime` before the division by the denominator or `365 days`.

            uint256 interestAccrued = (elapsedTime * 
                totalDebtAmount *
                settings.debtInterestApr.numerator) /
                settings.debtInterestApr.denominator /
                365 days;

            return  interestAccrued;

## Codebase Impressions & Summary

Overall, the code quality is high.

The findings here revolve around some commonly suggested practices.

## \[L-01] Add constructor initializers

As per [OpenZeppelin’s (OZ) recommendation](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/uupsupgradeable-vulnerability-post-mortem/15680/6), “The guidelines are now to make it impossible for *anyone* to run `initialize` on an implementation contract, by adding an empty constructor with the `initializer` modifier. So the implementation contract gets initialized automatically upon deployment.”

Note that this behaviour is also incorporated the [OZ Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/) since the UUPS vulnerability discovery: “Additionally, we modified the code generated by the [Wizard 19](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/) to include a constructor that automatically initializes the implementation when deployed.”

Furthermore, this thwarts any attempts to frontrun the initialization tx of these contracts:

```solidity
contracts/helpers/CryptoPunksHelper.sol:
  19:     function initialize(address punksAddress) external initializer {

contracts/helpers/EtherRocksHelper.sol:
  19:     function initialize(address rocksAddress) external initializer {

contracts/staking/JPEGStaking.sol:
  21:     function initialize(IERC20Upgradeable _jpeg) external initializer {

contracts/vaults/FungibleAssetVaultForDAO.sol:
  66:     function initialize(

contracts/vaults/NFTVault.sol:
  139:     function initialize(
```

## \[L-02] Immutable addresses should be 0-checked

Consider adding an `address(0)` check here (see `@audit`):

```solidity
contracts/farming/LPFarming.sol:
  77:         jpeg = IERC20(_jpeg); //@audit low: should be address(0) checked just like in yVaultLPFarming.sol and StrategyPUSDConvex.sol

contracts/vaults/yVault/Controller.sol:
  28:         jpeg = IERC20(_jpeg);  //@audit low: should be address(0) checked just like in yVaultLPFarming.sol and StrategyPUSDConvex.sol

contracts/vaults/yVault/yVault.sol:
  53:         token = ERC20(_token);  //@audit low: should be address(0)
```

## \[L-03] Unbounded loop on array can lead to DoS

As this array can grow quite large, the transaction's gas cost could exceed the block gas limit and make it impossible to call this function at all (see `@audit`):

```solidity
File: LPFarming.sol
141:     function add(uint256 _allocPoint, IERC20 _lpToken) external onlyOwner { 
...
146:         poolInfo.push( //@audit low: a push exist but there's no pop in the solution.
...
154:     }
...
347:     function claimAll() external nonReentrant noContract(msg.sender) {
348:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < poolInfo.length; i++) { //@audit low: poolInfo is unbounded
349:             _updatePool(i);
350:             _withdrawReward(i);
351:         }
...
360:     }
```

Consider introducing a reasonable upper limit based on block gas limits and/or adding a `remove` method to remove elements in the array.

## \[L-04] Add a timelock and event to critical functions

It is a good practice to give time for users to react and adjust to critical changes. A timelock provides more guarantees and reduces the level of trust required, thus decreasing risk for users. It also indicates that the project is legitimate.

Consider adding a timelock and event to:

    vaults/yVault/strategies/StrategyPUSDConvex.sol:177:    function setPerformanceFee(Rate memory _performanceFee)
    vaults/NFTVault.sol:290:    function setOrganizationFeeRate(Rate memory _organizationFeeRate)

## \[L-05] Fee in `StrategyPUSDConvex.setPerformanceFee()` should be upper-bounded

See `@audit`:

```solidity
File: StrategyPUSDConvex.sol
177:     function setPerformanceFee(Rate memory _performanceFee)
178:         public
179:         onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE)
180:     {
181:         require(
182:             _performanceFee.denominator > 0 &&
183:                 _performanceFee.denominator >= _performanceFee.numerator,
184:             "INVALID_RATE"
185:         );
186:         performanceFee = _performanceFee; //@audit low: fee can be 100% (_performanceFee.denominator == _performanceFee.numerator)
187:     }
```

## \[L-06] Fee in `NFTVault.setOrganizationFeeRate()`should be upper-bounded

See `@audit`:

```solidity
File: NFTVault.sol
290:     function setOrganizationFeeRate(Rate memory _organizationFeeRate)  
291:         external
292:         onlyRole(DAO_ROLE)
293:     {
294:         _validateRate(_organizationFeeRate);
295:         settings.organizationFeeRate = _organizationFeeRate; //@audit low: fee can be 100%
296:     }
...
400:     function _validateRate(Rate memory rate) internal pure {
401:         require(
402:             rate.denominator > 0 && rate.denominator >= rate.numerator,  //@audit low: fee can be 100% (rate.denominator == rate.numerator)
403:             "invalid_rate"
404:         );
405:     }
```

## \[L-07] A magical number should be documented and explained: `1e36`. Use a constant instead

```solidity
farming/LPFarming.sol:196:                1e36 *
farming/LPFarming.sol:207:            1e36;
farming/LPFarming.sol:307:            1e36 *
farming/LPFarming.sol:319:            1e36;
farming/yVaultLPFarming.sol:94:            1e36;
farming/yVaultLPFarming.sol:172:        newAccRewardsPerShare = accRewardPerShare + newRewards * 1e36 / totalStaked;
farming/yVaultLPFarming.sol:179:            (accRewardPerShare - userLastAccRewardPerShare[account])) / 1e36;
```

I suggest using `constant` variables as this would make the code more maintainable and readable while costing nothing gas-wise.

## \[N-01] Avoid floating pragmas: the version should be locked (preferably at >= `0.8.4`)

The pragma declared across the solution is `^0.8.0`. As the compiler introduces a several interesting upgrades in Solidity `0.8.4`, consider locking at this version or a more recent one.

## \[N-02] Related data should be grouped in a struct

The following `maps` should be grouped in structs.

From:

```solidity
contracts/farming/yVaultLPFarming.sol:
  31:     mapping(address => uint256) public balanceOf; //@audit NC: related data 1
  32:     mapping(address => uint256) private userLastAccRewardPerShare;//@audit NC: related data 2
  33:     mapping(address => uint256) private userPendingRewards;//@audit NC: related data 3

contracts/vaults/yVault/Controller.sol:
  20:     mapping(IERC20 => address) public vaults; //@audit NC: related data 1
  21:     mapping(IERC20 => IStrategy) public strategies; //@audit NC: related data 2
  22:     mapping(IERC20 => mapping(IStrategy => bool)) public approvedStrategies; //@audit NC: related data 3
```

To

```solidity
    struct UserInfo {
        uint256 balance;  
        uint256 lastAccRewardPerShare;
        uint256 pendingReward;
    }
    
    mapping(address => UserInfo) public userInfo;
```

And

```solidity
    struct TokenInfo {
        address vaults;  
        IStrategy approvedStrategies;
        mapping(IStrategy => bool) pendingReward;
    }
    
    mapping(IERC20 => TokenInfo) public tokenInfo;
```

It would be less error-prone, more readable, and it would be possible to delete all related fields with a simple `delete userInfo[address]`.

However, the sponsor should notice that `pendingReward` won't be as easily deleted in `tokenInfo`, as it's a `mapping` field. It would still improve code quality nonetheless.

## \[N-03] Unused named returns

Using both named returns and a return statement isn't necessary. Removing one of those can improve code clarity (see `@audit`):

```solidity
File: NFTEscrow.sol
081:     function precompute(address _owner, uint256 _idx)
082:         public
083:         view
084:         returns (bytes32 salt, address predictedAddress) //@audit NC: unused named returns
085:     {
...
091:         salt = sha256(abi.encodePacked(_owner));
...
105:         predictedAddress = address(uint160(uint256(hash)));
106:         return (salt, predictedAddress); //@audit NC: unused named returns
107:     }
```

## [G-01] `NFTEscrow._executeTransfer()`: Cheap Contract Deployment Through Clones

See `@audit` tag:

```solidity
67:     function _executeTransfer(address _owner, uint256 _idx) internal {
68:         (bytes32 salt, ) = precompute(_owner, _idx);
69:         new FlashEscrow{salt: salt}( //@audit gas: deployment can cost less through clones 
70:             nftAddress,
71:             _encodeFlashEscrowPayload(_idx)
72:         );
73:     }
```

There's a way to save a significant amount of gas on deployment using Clones: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mw-pMmJ7TA> .

This is a solution that was adopted, as an example, by Porter Finance. They realized that deploying using clones was 10x cheaper:

*   <https://github.com/porter-finance/v1-core/issues/15#issuecomment-1035639516>
*   <https://github.com/porter-finance/v1-core/pull/34>

I suggest applying a similar pattern.

## [G-02] `LPFarming.newEpoch()`: L128 and L133 should be unchecked due to parent if/else condition

Solidity version 0.8+ comes with implicit overflow and underflow checks on unsigned integers. When an overflow or an underflow isn't possible (as an example, when a comparison is made before the arithmetic operation), some gas can be saved by using an `unchecked` block: <https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.10/control-structures.html#checked-or-unchecked-arithmetic>

I suggest wrapping with an `unchecked` block here (see `@audit` tag):

```solidity
107:     function newEpoch(
...
111:     ) external onlyOwner {
127:         if (remainingRewards > newRewards) {
128:             jpeg.safeTransfer(msg.sender, remainingRewards - newRewards);  //@audit gas: should be unchecked (can't underflow due to L127)
129:         } else if (remainingRewards < newRewards) {
130:             jpeg.safeTransferFrom(
131:                 msg.sender,
132:                 address(this),
133:                 newRewards - remainingRewards  //@audit gas: should be unchecked (can't underflow due to L129)
134:             );
135:         }
136:     }
```

## [G-03] `LPFarming.withdraw()`: L248 should be unchecked due to L243

See `@audit` tag:

```solidity
235:     function withdraw(uint256 _pid, uint256 _amount)
236:         external
237:         noContract(msg.sender)
238:     {
239:         require(_amount > 0, "invalid_amount");
240: 
241:         PoolInfo storage pool = poolInfo[_pid];
242:         UserInfo storage user = userInfo[_pid][msg.sender];
243:         require(user.amount >= _amount, "insufficient_amount");
244: 
245:         _updatePool(_pid);
246:         _withdrawReward(_pid);
247: 
248:         user.amount -= _amount;  //@audit gas: should be unchecked (can't underflow due to L243)
```

## [G-04] `LPFarming._withdrawReward()`: `poolInfo[_pid].accRewardPerShare` should get cached

The code can be optimized by minimising the number of SLOADs. SLOADs are expensive (100 gas) compared to MLOADs/MSTOREs (3 gas). Here, the storage value should get cached in memory (see the `@audit` tags for further details):

```solidity
315:     function _withdrawReward(uint256 _pid) internal returns (uint256) {
316:         UserInfo storage user = userInfo[_pid][msg.sender];
317:         uint256 pending = (user.amount *
318:             (poolInfo[_pid].accRewardPerShare - user.lastAccRewardPerShare)) / //@audit gas: SLOAD 1 poolInfo[_pid].accRewardPerShare
319:             1e36;
320:         if (pending > 0) {
321:             userRewards[msg.sender] += pending;
322:         }
323: 
324:         user.lastAccRewardPerShare = poolInfo[_pid].accRewardPerShare; //@audit gas: SLOAD 2 poolInfo[_pid].accRewardPerShare
325: 
326:         return pending;
327:     }
```

## [G-05] `yVaultLPFarming.withdraw()`: L124 should be unchecked due to L119

See `@audit` tag:

```solidity
117:     function withdraw(uint256 _amount) external noContract(msg.sender) {
118:         require(_amount > 0, "invalid_amount");
119:         require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= _amount, "insufficient_amount");
120: 
121:         _update();
122:         _withdrawReward(msg.sender);
123: 
124:         balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _amount;  //@audit gas: should be unchecked (can't underflow due to L119)
```

## [G-06] `yVaultLPFarming._withdrawReward()`: `accRewardPerShare` should get cached

See `@audit` tags:

```solidity
177:     function _withdrawReward(address account) internal returns (uint256) {
178:         uint256 pending = (balanceOf[account] *
179:             (accRewardPerShare - userLastAccRewardPerShare[account])) / 1e36; //@audit gas: SLOAD 1 accRewardPerShare
180: 
181:         if (pending > 0) userPendingRewards[account] += pending;
182: 
183:         userLastAccRewardPerShare[account] = accRewardPerShare; //@audit gas: SLOAD 2 accRewardPerShare
184: 
185:         return pending;
186:     }
```

## [G-07] `JPEGLock.unlock()`: use `storage` instead of copying struct in memory L69

See `@audit` tag:

```solidity
68:     function unlock(uint256 _nftIndex) external nonReentrant {
69:         LockPosition memory position = positions[_nftIndex]; //@audit gas: costing 3 SLOADs while only lockAmount is needed twice. Replace "memory" with "storage" and cache only position.lockAmount 
70:         require(position.owner == msg.sender, "unauthorized");
71:         require(position.unlockAt <= block.timestamp, "locked");
72: 
73:         delete positions[_nftIndex];
74: 
75:         jpeg.safeTransfer(msg.sender, position.lockAmount);
76: 
77:         emit Unlock(msg.sender, _nftIndex, position.lockAmount);
78:     }
```

Here, a copy in memory is costing 3 SLOADs and 3 MSTORES. The, 2 variables are only read once through MLOAD (`position.owner` and `position.unlockAt`) and one is read twice (`position.lockAmount`).
I suggest replacing the `memory` keyword with `storage` at L69 and only copying `position.lockAmount` in memory.

## [G-08] `FungibleAssetVaultForDAO._collateralPriceUsd()`: `oracle` should get cached

See `@audit` tags:

```solidity
104:     function _collateralPriceUsd() internal view returns (uint256) {
105:         int256 answer = oracle.latestAnswer();  //@audit gas: SLOAD 1 oracle
106:         uint8 decimals = oracle.decimals();  //@audit gas: SLOAD 2 oracle
107: 
```

## [G-09] `FungibleAssetVaultForDAO._collateralPriceUsd()`: return statement should be unchecked

See `@audit` tag:

```solidity
104:     function _collateralPriceUsd() internal view returns (uint256) {
...
111:         return //@audit gas: whole return statement should be unchecked (obviously can't underflow/overflow here)
112:             decimals > 18
113:                 ? uint256(answer) / 10**(decimals - 18)  
114:                 : uint256(answer) * 10**(18 - decimals);  
115:     }
```

Due to the ternary condition and the fact that `int256 answer = oracle.latestAnswer();`, the return statement can't underflow and should be unchecked.

## [G-10] `FungibleAssetVaultForDAO.deposit()`: `collateralAsset` should get cached

See `@audit` tags:

```solidity
141:     function deposit(uint256 amount) external payable onlyRole(WHITELISTED_ROLE) {
142:         require(amount > 0, "invalid_amount");
143: 
144:         if (collateralAsset == ETH) {  //@audit gas: SLOAD 1 collateralAsset
145:             require(msg.value == amount, "invalid_msg_value");
146:         } else {
147:             require(msg.value == 0, "non_zero_eth_value");
148:             IERC20Upgradeable(collateralAsset).safeTransferFrom(  //@audit gas: SLOAD 2 collateralAsset
149:                 msg.sender,
150:                 address(this),
151:                 amount
152:             );
153:         }
```

## [G-11] `FungibleAssetVaultForDAO.repay)`: L184 should be unchecked due to L182

See `@audit` tag:

```solidity
179:     function repay(uint256 amount) external onlyRole(WHITELISTED_ROLE) nonReentrant {
180:         require(amount > 0, "invalid_amount");
181: 
182:         amount = amount > debtAmount ? debtAmount : amount;
183: 
184:         debtAmount -= amount; //@audit gas: should be unchecked (can't underflow due to L182)
```

## [G-12] `FungibleAssetVaultForDAO.withdraw()`: L196 should be unchecked due to L194

See `@audit` tag:

```solidity

194:         require(amount > 0 && amount <= collateralAmount, "invalid_amount");

## [G-13] `FungibleAssetVaultForDAO.withdraw()`: `collateralAmount` should get cached

See `@audit` tags:

194:         require(amount > 0 && amount <= collateralAmount, "invalid_amount");  //@audit gas: SLOAD 1 collateralAmount

199:         collateralAmount -= amount; //@audit gas: SLOAD 3 collateralAmount (could've used the a cached value for calculation)
```

## [G-14] `NFTVault._normalizeAggregatorAnswer()`: return statement should be unchecked

See `@audit` tag:

```solidity
454:     function _normalizeAggregatorAnswer(IAggregatorV3Interface aggregator)
455:         internal
456:         view

468:     }
```

## [G-15] `NFTVault._calculateAdditionalInterest()`: `totalDebtAmount` should get cached

See `@audit` tags:

```solidity
578:     function _calculateAdditionalInterest() internal view returns (uint256) {
...
585:         if (totalDebtAmount == 0) {  //@audit gas: SLOAD 1 totalDebtAmount
586:             return 0;
587:         }
588: 
589:         // Accrue interest
590:         uint256 interestPerYear = (totalDebtAmount *  //@audit gas: SLOAD 2 totalDebtAmount
```

## [G-16] `NFTVault.sol`: `struct PositionPreview` can be tightly packed to save 1 storage slot

From (see `@audit` tags):

```solidity
610:     struct PositionPreview { // @audit gas: can be tightly packed by moving borrowType and liquidatable at the end
611:         address owner;
612:         uint256 nftIndex;
613:         bytes32 nftType;
614:         uint256 nftValueUSD;
615:         VaultSettings vaultSettings;
616:         uint256 creditLimit;
617:         uint256 debtPrincipal;
618:         uint256 debtInterest; // @audit gas: 32 bytes
619:         BorrowType borrowType; // @audit gas: 1 byte (this enum is equivalent to uint8 as it has less than 256 options)
620:         bool liquidatable; // @audit gas: 1 byte
621:         uint256 liquidatedAt; // @audit gas: 32 bytes
622:         address liquidator; // @audit gas: 20 bytes
623:     }
```

To:

```solidity
    struct PositionPreview {
        address owner;
        uint256 nftIndex;
        bytes32 nftType;
        uint256 nftValueUSD;
        VaultSettings vaultSettings;
        uint256 creditLimit;
        uint256 debtPrincipal;
        uint256 debtInterest; // @audit gas: 32 bytes
        uint256 liquidatedAt; // @audit gas: 32 bytes
        BorrowType borrowType; // @audit gas: 1 byte (this enum is equivalent to uint8 as it has less than 256 options)
        bool liquidatable; // @audit gas: 1 byte
        address liquidator; // @audit gas: 20 bytes
    }
```

## [G-17] `NFTVault.showPosition()`: L659 should be unchecked due to L649

See `@audit` tag:

```solidity
File: NFTVault.sol
628:     function showPosition(uint256 _nftIndex)
...
649:         if (debtPrincipal > debtAmount) debtAmount = debtPrincipal;
...
659:             debtInterest: debtAmount - debtPrincipal, //@audit gas: should be unchecked (can't underflow due to L649)
```

## [G-18] `NFTVault.showPosition()`: `positions[_nftIndex].liquidatedAt` should get cached

See `@audit` tags:

```solidity
File: NFTVault.sol
628:     function showPosition(uint256 _nftIndex)
...
661:             liquidatable: positions[_nftIndex].liquidatedAt == 0 &&  //@audit gas: SLOAD 1 positions[_nftIndex].liquidatedAt
662:                 debtAmount >= _getLiquidationLimit(_nftIndex),
663:             liquidatedAt: positions[_nftIndex].liquidatedAt,  //@audit gas: SLOAD 2 positions[_nftIndex].liquidatedAt
```

## [G-19] `NFTVault.showPosition()`: Help the optimizer by saving a storage variable's reference instead of repeatedly fetching it (`positions[_nftIndex]`)

To help the optimizer, declare a `storage` type variable and use it instead of repeatedly fetching the reference in a map or an array.

The effect can be quite significant.

Here, instead of repeatedly calling `positions[_nftIndex]`, save its reference like this: `Position storage _position = positions[_nftIndex]` and use it.

Impacted lines (see `@audit` tags):

```solidity
  636:         uint256 debtPrincipal = positions[_nftIndex].debtPrincipal; //@audit gas: use the suggested storage variable "Position storage _position"
  637:         uint256 debtAmount = positions[_nftIndex].liquidatedAt > 0 //@audit gas: use the suggested storage variable "Position storage _position"
  638:             ? positions[_nftIndex].debtAmountForRepurchase //@audit gas: use the suggested storage variable "Position storage _position"
  641:                 positions[_nftIndex].debtPortion, //@audit gas: use the suggested storage variable "Position storage _position"
  660:             borrowType: positions[_nftIndex].borrowType, //@audit gas: use the suggested storage variable "Position storage _position"
  661:             liquidatable: positions[_nftIndex].liquidatedAt == 0 && //@audit gas: use the suggested storage variable "Position storage _position"
  663:             liquidatedAt: positions[_nftIndex].liquidatedAt, //@audit gas: use the suggested storage variable "Position storage _position"
  664:             liquidator: positions[_nftIndex].liquidator //@audit gas: use the suggested storage variable "Position storage _position"
```

This practice already exists in the solution, as seen in `NFTVault.borrow()`:

```solidity
675:     function borrow(
...
697:         Position storage position = positions[_nftIndex];
```

## [G-20] `NFTVault.borrow()`: `totalDebtPortion` should get cached

See `@audit` tags:

```solidity
675:     function borrow(
...
735:         if (totalDebtPortion == 0) {  //@audit gas: SLOAD 1 totalDebtPortion
...
738:         } else {
739:             uint256 plusPortion = (totalDebtPortion * _amount) / //@audit gas: SLOAD 2 totalDebtPortion
740:                 totalDebtAmount;
741:             totalDebtPortion += plusPortion; //@audit gas: SLOAD 3 totalDebtPortion (could've used cached value for calculation)
```

## [G-21] `NFTVault.repay()`: L781 should be unchecked due to ternary operator

See `@audit` tag:

```solidity
756:     function repay(uint256 _nftIndex, uint256 _amount)
...
780:         uint256 paidPrincipal = _amount > debtInterest
781:             ? _amount - debtInterest //@audit gas: should be unchecked (obviously)
782:             : 0;
```

## [G-22] `NFTVault.repay()`: `totalDebtPortion` and `totalDebtAmount` should get cached

See `@audit` tags:

```solidity
756:     function repay(uint256 _nftIndex, uint256 _amount)
...
784:         uint256 minusPortion = paidPrincipal == debtPrincipal
785:             ? position.debtPortion
786:             : (totalDebtPortion * _amount) / totalDebtAmount; //@audit gas: SLOADs 1 totalDebtPortion & totalDebtAmount
787: 
788:         totalDebtPortion -= minusPortion; //@audit gas: SLOAD 2 totalDebtPortion (could've used cached value for calculation)
...
791:         totalDebtAmount -= _amount; //@audit gas: SLOAD 2 totalDebtAmount (could've used cached value for calculation)
```

## [G-23] `Controller.setStrategy()`: boolean comparison L87

Comparing to a constant (`true` or `false`) is a bit more expensive than directly checking the returned boolean value.
I suggest using `if(directValue)` instead of `if(directValue == true)` and `if(!directValue)` instead of `if(directValue == false)` here (see `@audit` tag):

```solidity
82:     function setStrategy(IERC20 _token, IStrategy _strategy)
83:         external
84:         onlyRole(STRATEGIST_ROLE)
85:     {
86:         require(
87:             approvedStrategies[_token][_strategy] == true, //@audit gas: instead of comparing to a constant, just use "approvedStrategies[_token][_strategy]"
```

## [G-24] `StrategyPUSDConvex.balanceOfJPEG()`: `jpeg` should get cached

See `@audit` tags:

```solidity
226:     function balanceOfJPEG() external view returns (uint256) {
227:         uint256 availableBalance = jpeg.balanceOf(address(this)); //@audit gas: SLOAD 1 jpeg
...
231:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) {
...
233:             if (address(jpeg) == extraReward.rewardToken()) { //@audit gas: SLOADs in Loop for jpeg. Cache it at L227
```

## [G-25] `StrategyPUSDConvex.balanceOfJPEG()`: use a `return` statement instead of `break`

See `@audit` tag:

```solidity
226:     function balanceOfJPEG() external view returns (uint256) {
...
231:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) {
...
233:             if (address(jpeg) == extraReward.rewardToken()) {
234:                 availableBalance += extraReward.earned();
235:                 //we found jpeg, no need to continue the loop
236:                 break; //@audit gas: instead of adding to availableBalance & breaking, just return here "availableBalance + extraReward.earned()"
237:             }
238:         }
239: 
240:         return availableBalance;
241:     }
```

Here, instead of making a memory operation with `availableBalance += extraReward.earned();` and then using `break;` before returning the memory variable `availableBalance`, it would've been more optimized to just return `availableBalance + extraReward.earned()`:

```solidity
    function balanceOfJPEG() external view returns (uint256) {
...
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) {
...
            if (address(jpeg) == extraReward.rewardToken()) {
              return availableBalance + extraReward.earned();
            }
        }
    }
```

## [G-26] `StrategyPUSDConvex.withdraw()`: L281 should be unchecked due to L279

See `@audit` tag:

```solidity
273:     function withdraw(uint256 _amount) external onlyController {
...
279:         if (balance < _amount)
280:             convexConfig.baseRewardPool.withdrawAndUnwrap(
281:                 _amount - balance, //@audit gas: should be unchecked (can't underflow due to L279)
282:                 false
283:             );
```

## [G-27] `StrategyPUSDConvex.harvest()`: L362 should be unchecked due to L359-L360 and how performanceFee is set L183

See `@audit` tags:

```solidity
177:     function setPerformanceFee(Rate memory _performanceFee)
...
181:         require(
182:             _performanceFee.denominator > 0 &&
183:                 _performanceFee.denominator >= _performanceFee.numerator, //@audit gas: can uncheck L362 thanks to this
184:             "INVALID_RATE"
185:         );
...
311:     function harvest(uint256 minOutCurve) external onlyRole(STRATEGIST_ROLE) {
...
359:         uint256 fee = (usdcBalance * performanceFee.numerator) /
360:             performanceFee.denominator;
361:         usdc.safeTransfer(strategy.controller.feeAddress(), fee);
362:         usdcBalance -= fee; //@audit gas: should be unchecked (can't underflow due to L359-L360 & how performanceFee is set L183)
```

## [G-28] `yVault.earn()`: `token` and `controller` should get cached

See `@audit` tags:

```solidity
129:     function earn() external {
130:         uint256 _bal = available();
131:         token.safeTransfer(address(controller), _bal); //@audit gas: SLOADs 1 token & controller
132:         controller.earn(address(token), _bal); //@audit gas: SLOADs 2 token & controller
133:     }
```

## [G-29] `yVault.withdraw()`: L178 should be unchecked due to L177

See `@audit` tag:

```solidity
166:     function withdraw(uint256 _shares) public noContract(msg.sender) {
...
177:         if (vaultBalance < backingTokens) {
178:             uint256 toWithdraw = backingTokens - vaultBalance; //@audit gas: should be unchecked (can't underflow due to L177)
```

## [G-30] `yVault.withdraw()`: `token` should get cached

See `@audit` tags:

```solidity
166:     function withdraw(uint256 _shares) public noContract(msg.sender) {
...
176:         uint256 vaultBalance = token.balanceOf(address(this)); //@audit gas: SLOAD 1 token
177:         if (vaultBalance < backingTokens) {
178:             uint256 toWithdraw = backingTokens - vaultBalance;
179:             controller.withdraw(address(token), toWithdraw);  //@audit gas: SLOAD 2 token
180:         }
181: 
182:         token.safeTransfer(msg.sender, backingTokens);  //@audit gas: SLOAD 3 token
```

## [G-31] `yVault.withdrawJPEG()`: `farm` should get cached

See `@audit` tags:

```solidity
187:     function withdrawJPEG() external {
188:         require(farm != address(0), "NO_FARM");  //@audit gas: SLOAD 1 farm
189:         controller.withdrawJPEG(address(token), farm);  //@audit gas: SLOAD 2 farm
190:     }
```

## [G-32] Upgrade pragma to at least 0.8.4

Across the whole solution, the declared pragma is `^0.8.0`.

Using newer compiler versions and the optimizer give gas optimizations. Also, additional safety checks are available for free.

The advantages here are:

*   **Low level inliner** (>= 0.8.2): Cheaper runtime gas (especially relevant when the contract has small functions).
*   **Optimizer improvements in packed structs** (>= 0.8.3)
*   **Custom errors** (>= 0.8.4): cheaper deployment cost and runtime cost. *Note*: the runtime cost is only relevant when the revert condition is met. In short, replace revert strings by custom errors.

Consider upgrading pragma to at least 0.8.4:

## [G-33] No need to explicitly initialize variables with default values

If a variable is not set/initialized, it is assumed to have the default value (`0` for `uint`, `false` for `bool`, `address(0)` for address...). Explicitly initializing it with its default value is an anti-pattern and wastes gas.

As an example: `for (uint256 i = 0; i < numIterations; ++i) {` should be replaced with `for (uint256 i; i < numIterations; ++i) {`

Instances include:

```solidity
farming/LPFarming.sol:281:        for (uint256 pid = 0; pid < length; ++pid) {
farming/LPFarming.sol:348:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < poolInfo.length; i++) {
vaults/yVault/strategies/StrategyPUSDConvex.sol:145:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _strategyConfig.rewardTokens.length; i++) {
vaults/yVault/strategies/StrategyPUSDConvex.sol:231:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) {
vaults/yVault/strategies/StrategyPUSDConvex.sol:319:            for (uint256 i = 0; i < rewardTokens.length; i++) {
vaults/FungibleAssetVaultForDAO.sol:45:    address internal constant ETH = address(0);
vaults/NFTVault.sol:181:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _typeInitializers.length; i++) {
vaults/NFTVault.sol:184:            for (uint256 j = 0; j < initializer.nfts.length; j++) {
```

I suggest removing explicit initializations for default values.

## [G-34] `> 0` is less efficient than `!= 0` for unsigned integers (with proof)

`!= 0` costs less gas compared to `> 0` for unsigned integers in `require` statements with the optimizer enabled (6 gas)

Proof: While it may seem that `> 0` is cheaper than `!=`, this is only true without the optimizer enabled and outside a require statement. If you enable the optimizer at 10k AND you're in a `require` statement, this will save gas. You can see this tweet for more proofs: <https://twitter.com/gzeon/status/1485428085885640706>

I suggest changing `> 0` with `!= 0` here:

```solidity

```

Also, please enable the Optimizer.

## [G-35] `>=` is cheaper than `>`

Strict inequalities (`>`) are more expensive than non-strict ones (`>=`). This is due to some supplementary checks (ISZERO, 3 gas)

I suggest using  `>=`  instead of `>` to avoid some opcodes here:

```solidity
vaults/NFTVault.sol:539:        return principal > calculatedDebt ? principal : calculatedDebt;
vaults/NFTVault.sol:775:        _amount = _amount > debtAmount ? debtAmount : _amount;
```

## [G-36] An array's length should be cached to save gas in for-loops

Reading array length at each iteration of the loop takes 6 gas (3 for mload and 3 to place memory_offset) in the stack.

Caching the array length in the stack saves around 3 gas per iteration.

Here, I suggest storing the array's length in a variable before the for-loop, and use it instead:

```solidity
farming/LPFarming.sol:348:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < poolInfo.length; i++) {
vaults/yVault/strategies/StrategyPUSDConvex.sol:145:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _strategyConfig.rewardTokens.length; i++) {
vaults/yVault/strategies/StrategyPUSDConvex.sol:319:            for (uint256 i = 0; i < rewardTokens.length; i++) {
vaults/NFTVault.sol:181:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _typeInitializers.length; i++) {
vaults/NFTVault.sol:184:            for (uint256 j = 0; j < initializer.nfts.length; j++) {
```

This is already done here:

```solidity
farming/LPFarming.sol:281:        for (uint256 pid = 0; pid < length; ++pid) {
vaults/yVault/strategies/StrategyPUSDConvex.sol:231:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) {
```

## [G-37] `++i` costs less gas compared to `i++` or `i += 1`

`++i` costs less gas compared to `i++` or `i += 1` for unsigned integer, as pre-increment is cheaper (about 5 gas per iteration). This statement is true even with the optimizer enabled.

`i++` increments `i` and returns the initial value of `i`. Which means:

```solidity
uint i = 1;  
i++; // == 1 but i == 2  
```

But `++i` returns the actual incremented value:

```solidity
uint i = 1;  
++i; // == 2 and i == 2 too, so no need for a temporary variable  
```

In the first case, the compiler has to create a temporary variable (when used) for returning `1` instead of `2`

Instances include:

```solidity
farming/LPFarming.sol:348:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < poolInfo.length; i++) {
vaults/yVault/strategies/StrategyPUSDConvex.sol:145:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _strategyConfig.rewardTokens.length; i++) {
vaults/yVault/strategies/StrategyPUSDConvex.sol:231:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) {
vaults/yVault/strategies/StrategyPUSDConvex.sol:319:            for (uint256 i = 0; i < rewardTokens.length; i++) {
vaults/NFTVault.sol:181:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _typeInitializers.length; i++) {
vaults/NFTVault.sol:184:            for (uint256 j = 0; j < initializer.nfts.length; j++) {
```

I suggest using `++i` instead of `i++` to increment the value of an uint variable.

This is already done here:

```solidity
farming/LPFarming.sol:281:        for (uint256 pid = 0; pid < length; ++pid) {
```

## [G-38] Increments can be unchecked

In Solidity 0.8+, there's a default overflow check on unsigned integers. It's possible to uncheck this in for-loops and save some gas at each iteration, but at the cost of some code readability, as this uncheck cannot be made inline.

[ethereum/solidity#10695](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10695)

Instances include:

```solidity
farming/LPFarming.sol:281:        for (uint256 pid = 0; pid < length; ++pid) {
farming/LPFarming.sol:348:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < poolInfo.length; i++) {
vaults/yVault/strategies/StrategyPUSDConvex.sol:145:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _strategyConfig.rewardTokens.length; i++) {
vaults/yVault/strategies/StrategyPUSDConvex.sol:231:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) {
vaults/yVault/strategies/StrategyPUSDConvex.sol:319:            for (uint256 i = 0; i < rewardTokens.length; i++) {
vaults/NFTVault.sol:181:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _typeInitializers.length; i++) {
vaults/NFTVault.sol:184:            for (uint256 j = 0; j < initializer.nfts.length; j++) {
```

The code would go from:

```solidity
for (uint256 i; i < numIterations; i++) {  
 // ...  
}  
```

to:

```solidity
for (uint256 i; i < numIterations;) {  
 // ...  
 unchecked { ++i; }  
}  
```

The risk of overflow is inexistant for a `uint256` here.

## [G-39] Use `calldata` instead of `memory`

When arguments are read-only on external functions, the data location should be `calldata`:

```solidity
contracts/vaults/NFTVault.sol:
  212:     function setDebtInterestApr(Rate memory _debtInterestApr) //@audit gas: should be calldata
  222:     function setValueIncreaseLockRate(Rate memory _valueIncreaseLockRate)  //@audit gas: should be calldata
  232:     function setCreditLimitRate(Rate memory _creditLimitRate)  //@audit gas: should be calldata
  247:     function setLiquidationLimitRate(Rate memory _liquidationLimitRate)  //@audit gas: should be calldata
  290:     function setOrganizationFeeRate(Rate memory _organizationFeeRate)  //@audit gas: should be calldata
  300:     function setInsurancePurchaseRate(Rate memory _insurancePurchaseRate)  //@audit gas: should be calldata
  311:         Rate memory _insuranceLiquidationPenaltyRate  //@audit gas: should be calldata
```

## [G-40] Consider making some constants as non-public to save gas

Reducing from `public` to `private` or `internal` can save gas when a constant isn't used outside of its contract.
I suggest changing the visibility from `public` to `internal` or `private` here:

```solidity
tokens/JPEG.sol:10:    bytes32 public constant MINTER_ROLE = keccak256("MINTER_ROLE");
tokens/StableCoin.sol:22:    bytes32 public constant MINTER_ROLE = keccak256("MINTER_ROLE");
tokens/StableCoin.sol:23:    bytes32 public constant PAUSER_ROLE = keccak256("PAUSER_ROLE");
vaults/yVault/strategies/StrategyPUSDConvex.sol:66:    bytes32 public constant STRATEGIST_ROLE = keccak256("STRATEGIST_ROLE");
vaults/yVault/Controller.sol:15:    bytes32 public constant STRATEGIST_ROLE = keccak256("STRATEGIST_ROLE");
vaults/FungibleAssetVaultForDAO.sol:41:    bytes32 public constant WHITELISTED_ROLE = keccak256("WHITELISTED_ROLE");
vaults/NFTVault.sol:71:    bytes32 public constant DAO_ROLE = keccak256("DAO_ROLE");
vaults/NFTVault.sol:72:    bytes32 public constant LIQUIDATOR_ROLE = keccak256("LIQUIDATOR_ROLE");
vaults/NFTVault.sol:74:    bytes32 public constant CUSTOM_NFT_HASH = keccak256("CUSTOM");
```

## [G-41] Public functions to external

The following functions could be set external to save gas and improve code quality.
External call cost is less expensive than of public functions.

```solidity
withdraw(IERC20,uint256) should be declared external:
 - Controller.withdraw(IERC20,uint256) (contracts/vaults/yVault/Controller.sol#151-154)
setFarmingPool(address) should be declared external:
 - YVault.setFarmingPool(address) (contracts/vaults/yVault/yVault.sol#115-118)
```

## [G-42] Reduce the size of error messages (Long revert Strings)

Shortening revert strings to fit in 32 bytes will decrease deployment time gas and will decrease runtime gas when the revert condition is met.

Revert strings that are longer than 32 bytes require at least one additional mstore, along with additional overhead for computing memory offset, etc.

Revert strings > 32 bytes:

```solidity
tokens/JPEG.sol:23:            "JPEG: must have minter role to mint"
tokens/StableCoin.sol:41:            "StableCoin: must have minter role to mint"
tokens/StableCoin.sol:55:            "StableCoin: must have pauser role to pause"
tokens/StableCoin.sol:69:            "StableCoin: must have pauser role to unpause"
vaults/NFTVault.sol:394:            "credit_rate_exceeds_or_equals_liquidation_rate" 
```

I suggest shortening the revert strings to fit in 32 bytes, or using custom errors as described next.

## [G-43] Use Custom Errors instead of Revert Strings to save Gas

Custom errors from Solidity 0.8.4 are cheaper than revert strings (cheaper deployment cost and runtime cost when the revert condition is met)

Source: <https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/>:

> Starting from [Solidity v0.8.4](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.4), there is a convenient and gas-efficient way to explain to users why an operation failed through the use of custom errors. Until now, you could already use strings to give more information about failures (e.g., `revert("Insufficient funds.");`), but they are rather expensive, especially when it comes to deploy cost, and it is difficult to use dynamic information in them.

Custom errors are defined using the `error` statement, which can be used inside and outside of contracts (including interfaces and libraries).
