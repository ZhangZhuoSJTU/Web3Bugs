# Overview

## About C4

Code 432n4 (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Yield smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between August 11—August 14 2021.

## Wardens

8 Wardens contributed reports to the Yield micro code contest:

This contest was judged by [ghoul.sol](https://twitter.com/ghoulsol).

Final report assembled by [moneylegobatman](https://twitter.com/money_lego) and [ninek](https://twitter.com/_ninek_).

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 21 unique vulnerabilities and 48 total findings.   All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding

Of these vulnerabilities, 5 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity, 4 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity, and 12 received a risk rating in the category of LOW severity.

C4 analysis also identified 9 non-critical recommendations and 18 gas optimizations.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Yield micro code contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-yield) is comprised of 61 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 4,115 lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code423n4.com).

# High Risk Findings (5)

## [[H-01] `CompositeMultiOracle` returns wrong decimals for prices?](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-yield-findings/issues/26)
_Submitted by cmichel_

The `CompositeMultiOracle.peek/get` functions seem to return wrong prices.
It's unclear what decimals `source.decimals` refers to in this case. Does it refer to `source.source` token decimals?

It chains the price arguments through `_peek` function calls and a single price is computed as:

```solidity
(priceOut, updateTimeOut) = IOracle(source.source).peek(base, quote, 10 ** source.decimals);   // Get price for one unit
// @audit shouldn't this divide by 10 ** IOracle(source.source).decimals() instead?
priceOut = priceIn * priceOut / (10 ** source.decimals);
```

Assume all oracles use 18 decimals (`oracle.decimals()` returns 18) and `source.decimals` refers to the _token decimals_ of `source.source`.

Then going from `USDC -> DAI -> USDT` (`path = [DAI]`) starts with a price of `1e18` in `peek`:
- `_peek(USDC, DAI, 1e18)`: Gets the price of `1e6 USDC` (as USDC has 6 decimals) in DAI with 18 decimals precision (because all oracle precision is set to 18): `priceOut = priceIn * 1e18 / 1e6 = 1e18 * 1e18 / 1e6 = 1e30`
- `_peek(DAI, USDT, 1e30)`: Gets the price of `1e18 DAI` (DAI has 18 decimals) with 18 decimals precision: `priceOut = priceIn * 1e18 / 1e18 = priceIn = 1e30`

It then uses `1e30` as the price to go from `USDC` to `USDT`: `value = price * amount / 1e18 = 1e30 * (1.0 USDC) / 1e18 = 1e30 * 1e6 / 1e18 = 1e18 = 1e12 * 1e6 = 1_000_000_000_000.0 USDT`. Inflating the actual `USDT` amount.

The issue is that `peek` assumes that the final price is in 18 decimals in the `value = price * amount / 1e18` division by `1e18`.
But `_peek` (and `_get`) don't enforce this.

Recommend that `_peek` should scale the prices to `1e18` by doing:

```solidity
(priceOut, updateTimeOut) = IOracle(source.source).get(base, quote, 10 ** source.decimals);
// priceOut will have same decimals as priceIn if we divide by oracle decimals
priceOut = priceIn * priceOut / (10 ** IOracle(source.source).decimals());
```

It does not need to divide by the `source.source` _token precision_ (`source.decimals`), but by the oracle precision (`IOracle(source.source).decimals()`).

 > Further [refactored all oracles so that decimals are handled properly](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/vault-v2/pull/276), and work on taking an amount of base as input, and returning an amount of quote as output. Our oracles don't have decimals themselves anymore as a state variable, since the return values are in the decimals of quote. This means that CompositeMultiOracle is agnostic with regards to decimals, and doesn't even need to know about them.


## [[H-02] `ERC20Rewards` returns wrong rewards if no tokens initially exist](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-yield-findings/issues/28)
_Submitted by cmichel_

The `ERC20Rewards._updateRewardsPerToken` function exits without updating `rewardsPerToken_.lastUpdated` if `totalSupply` is zero, i.e., if there are no tokens initially.

This leads to an error if there is an active rewards period but no tokens have been minted yet.

**Example:** `rewardsPeriod.start: 1 month ago`, `rewardsPeriod.end: in 1 month`, `totalSupply == 0`.

The first mint leads to the user (mintee) receiving all rewards for the past period (50% of the total rewards in this case).
- `_mint` is called, calls `_updateRewardsPerToken` which short-circuits. `rewardsPerToken.lastUpdated` is still set to `rewardsPeriod.start` from the constructor. Then `_updateUserRewards` is called and does not currently yield any rewards. (because both balance and the index diff are zero). User has now minted the tokens, `totalSupply` increases and user balance is set.
- User performs a `claim`: `_updateRewardsPerToken` is called and `timeSinceLastUpdated = end - rewardsPerToken_.lastUpdated = block.timestamp - rewardsPeriod.start = 1 month`. Contract "issues" rewards for the past month. The first mintee receives all of it.

The first mintee receives all pending rewards when they should not receive any past rewards.
This can easily happen if the token is new, the reward period has already been initialized and is running, but the protocol has not officially launched yet.
Note that `setRewards` also allows setting a date in the past which would also be fatal in this case.

Recommend that the `rewardsPerToken_.lastUpdated` field must always be updated in `_updateRewardsPerToken` to the current time (or `end`) even if `_totalSupply == 0`. Don't return early.

## [[H-03] `ERC20Rewards` breaks when setting a different token](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-yield-findings/issues/29)
_Submitted by cmichel_

The `setRewards` function allows setting a different token.
Holders of a previous reward period cannot all be paid out and will receive **their old reward amount** in the new token.

This leads to issues when the new token is more (less) valuable, or uses different decimals.

**Example:** Assume the first reward period paid out in `DAI` which has 18 decimals. Someone would have received `1.0 DAI = 1e18 DAI` if they called `claim` now. Instead, they wait until the new period starts with `USDC` (using only 6 decimals) and can `claim` their `1e18` reward amount in USDC which would equal `1e12 USDC`, one trillion USD.

Changing the reward token only works if old and new tokens use the same decimals and have the exact same value. Otherwise, users that claim too late/early will lose out.

Recommend disallowing changing the reward token, or clearing user's pending rewards of the old token. The second approach requires more code changes and keeping track of what token a user last claimed.

 > Maybe I should have used stronger language:

> The issue is known, but you are right in pointing it out. There are few situations in which changing the rewards token would make sense (such as replacing a faulty rewards token by a fixed one). I think it would be best to just disallow changing the token.

## [[H-04] Rewards accumulated can stay constant and often not increment](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-yield-findings/issues/65)
_Submitted by moose-code_

`rewardsPerToken_.accumulated` can stay constant while `rewardsPerToken_.lastUpdated` is continually updated, leading to no actual rewards being distributed. I.e. No rewards accumulate.

Line 115, `rewardsPerToken_.accumulated` could stay constant if there are very quick update intervals, a relatively low `rewardsPerToken_.rate` and a decent supply of the ERC20 token.

I.e. imagine the token supply is 1 billion tokens (quite a common amount, note even if a supply of only say 1 million tokens this is still relevant). i.e. 1e27 wei.

Line 115 has
```solidity
1e18 * timeSinceLastUpdated * rewardsPerToken_.rate / _totalSupply
```

`timeSinceLastUpdated` can be crafted to be arbitrarily small by simply transferring or burning tokens, so lets exclude this term (it could be 10 seconds etc). Imagine total supply is 1e27 as mentioned.

Therefore, `1e18 * rewardsPerToken_.rate / 1e27`, which shows that if the `rewardsPerToken_.rate` is < 1e9, something which is very likely, then the accumulated amount won't increment, as there are no decimals in solidity and this line of code will evaluate to adding zero. While this is rounded down to zero, critically, ` rewardsPerToken_.lastUpdated = end;` is updated.

The reason I have labelled this as a high risk is the express purpose of this contract is to reward users with tokens, yet a user could potentially quite easily exploit this line to ensure no one ever gets rewards and the accumulated amount never increases.

Given a fairly large token supply, and a relatively low emissions rate is set, that satisfies the above equation, for the entire duration of the rewards period, the user simply sends tokens back and forth every couple seconds (gas limitations, but layer 2), to keep the delta `timeSinceLastUpdated` close to 1.

This way the accumulated amount will never tick up, but time keeps being counted.

Furthermore, I would say this is high risk as this wouldn't even need an attacker. Given the transfer function is likely often being called by users, `timeSinceLastUpdated` will naturally be very low anyways.

Even if not so extreme as the above case, Alberto points out that "rounding can eat into the rewards" which is likely to be prevalent in the current scenario and make a big impact over time on the targeted vs actual distribution.

Again, this problem is more likely to occur in naturally liquid tokens where lots of transfer, mint or burn events occur.

As suggested by Alberto, the simplest it to probably not update the `rewardsPerToken_.lastUpdated` field if `rewardsPerToken_.accumulated` does not change. Although this change should be closely scrutinized to see it doesn't introduce bugs elsewhere.

## [[H-05] Exchange rates from Compound are assumed with 18 decimals](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-yield-findings/issues/38)
_Submitted by shw_

The `CTokenMultiOracle` contract assumes the exchange rates (borrowing rate) of Compound always have 18 decimals, while, however, which is not true. According to the [Compound documentation](https://compound.finance/docs/ctokens#exchange-rate), the exchange rate returned from the `exchangeRateCurrent` function is scaled by `1 * 10^(18 - 8 + Underlying Token Decimals)` (and so does `exchangeRateStored`). Using a wrong decimal number on the exchange rate could cause incorrect pricing on tokens. See [`CTokenMultiOracle.sol` #L110](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-yield/blob/main/contracts/oracles/compound/CTokenMultiOracle.sol#L110).

Recommend following the documentation and getting the decimals of the underlying tokens to set the correct decimal of a `Source`.

# Medium Risk Findings (4)

## [[M-01] No ERC20 safe* versions called](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-yield-findings/issues/31)
_Submitted by cmichel, also found by JMukesh and hickuphh3_

The `claim` function performs an ERC20 transfer `rewardsToken.transfer(to, claiming);` but does not check the return value, nor does it work with all legacy tokens.

Some tokens (like USDT) don't correctly implement the EIP20 standard and their `transfer`/`transferFrom` function return `void` instead of a success boolean. Calling these functions with the correct EIP20 function signatures will always revert.

The `ERC20.transfer()` and `ERC20.transferFrom()` functions return a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked for success.
Some tokens do **not** revert if the transfer failed but return `false` instead.

Tokens that don't actually perform the transfer and return `false` are still counted as a correct transfer and tokens that don't correctly implement the latest EIP20 spec, like USDT, will be unusable in the protocol as they revert the transaction because of the missing return value.

Recommend using OpenZeppelin’s `SafeERC20` versions with the `safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom` functions that handle the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.

## [[M-02] `TimeLock` cannot schedule the same calls multiple times](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-yield-findings/issues/27)
_Submitted by cmichel_

The `TimeLock.schedule` function reverts if the same `targets` and `data` fields are used as the `txHash` will be the same.
This means one cannot schedule the same transactions multiple times.

Imagine the delay is set to 30 days, but a contractor needs to be paid every 2 weeks. One needs to wait 30 days before scheduling the second payment to them.

Recommend also including `eta` in the hash. (Compound's `Timelock` does it as well.) This way the same transaction data can be used by specifying a different `eta`.

## [[M-03] Rewards squatting - setting rewards in different ERC20 tokens opens various economic attacks. ](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-yield-findings/issues/64)
_Submitted by moose-code, also found by hickuphh3_

Users essentially have an option to either claim currently earned reward amounts on future rewards tokens, or the current rewards token.

Although stated on line 84, it does not take into account the implications the lock in this contract will have on the future value of new tokens able to be issued via rewards.

Smart users will monitor the mempool for `setRewards` transactions. If the new reward token (token b) is less valuable than the old reward token (token a), they can  front run this transaction by calling claim. Otherwise, they let their accrued 'token a' roll into rewards of of the more valuable 'token b'.

Given loads of users will likely hold these tokens from day 1, there will potentially be thousands of different addresses squatting on rewards.

Economically, and given the above, it makes sense that the value of new reward tokens, i.e. 'token b' should always be less than that of 'token a'. This is undesirable in a rewards token contract, as there is no reliable way to start issuing a more valuable token at a later stage, unless exposing yourself to a major risk of reward squatting.

i.e. You could not issue a more valuable token in future (for example, if we wanted to run a rewards period issuing an asset like WETH rewards for 10 days) after first initially issuing DAI as a reward. This hamstrings flexibility of the contract.

P.s. This is one of the slickest contracts I've read. Love how awesome it is.Just believe this should be fixed, then its good to go.

It is true you could probably write a script to manually go call `claim` on thousands of squatting token addresses but this is a poor solution.

Recommend instead, that a simple mapping pattern could be used with an index mapping to a reward cycle with a reward token and a new accumulative etc. Users would likely need to be given a period a to claim from old reward cycles before their token balance could no longer reliably used to calculate past rewards. The would still be able to claim everything up until their last action (even though this may be before the rewards cycle ended).

## [[M-04] Use `safeTransfer` instead of `transfer`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-yield-findings/issues/36)
_Submitted by shw_

Tokens not compliant with the ERC20 specification could return `false` from the `transfer` function call to indicate the transfer fails, while the calling contract would not notice the failure if the return value is not checked. Checking the return value is a requirement, as written in the [EIP-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) specification:
> Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`. Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!

See [ERC20Rewards.sol L175](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-yield/blob/main/contracts/utils/token/ERC20Rewards.sol#L175).

Recommend using the `SafeERC20` library [implementation](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol) from OpenZeppelin and calling `safeTransfer` or `safeTransferFrom` when transferring ERC20 tokens.

# Low Risk Findings (12)

## [[L-01] `updateTime` of get is 0](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-yield-findings/issues/7)
_Submitted by gpersoon, also found by shw_

In function `_get` of `CompositeMultiOracle` the `updateTime` is not initialized, so it will be 0.

Function `_get` has the following statement:
```solidity
   updateTimeOut = (updateTimeOut < updateTimeIn) ? updateTimeOut : updateTimeIn;

updateTimeIn ==0 ==>  (updateTimeOut < updateTimeIn)== false ==> result of the expression is updateTimeIn == 0 ==> updateTimeOut =0
```

So this means the function get will always return `updateTime==0`

The `updateTime` result of the function `get` doesn't seem to be used in the code so the risk is low. If would only be relevant for future code updates.

Recommend adding the following in the beginning of the `_get` function:
`updateTime = block.timestamp;`

_Submitted by 0xRajeev_

solc version 0.8.3 and 0.8.4 fixed important bugs in the compiler. Using version 0.8.1 misses these fixes and may cause a vulnerability.

See [`ERC20Rewards.sol` L2](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-yield/blob/4dc46470e616dd0cbd9db9b4742e36c4d809e02c/contracts/utils/token/ERC20Rewards.sol#L2).
[Solidity 0.8.4](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.4) fixes a bug in the ABI decoder. The release contains an important bugfix. See decoding from memory bug blog post for more details.

[Solidity 0.8.3](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.3) is a bugfix release that fixes an important bug about how the optimizer handles the Keccak256 opcode. For details on the bug, please see the bug blog post.

Recommend considering upgrading to 0.8.3 or 0.8.4.

That `cauldron_` parameter is not used here and `ladle_.cauldron()` is used instead. The `Ladle` constructor initializes its cauldron value and so the only way this could differ from the parameter is if the argument to this function is specified incorrectly. See issue page for referenced code.

Recommend either using parameter, or remove it in favor of the value from `ladle_.cauldron()`.

## [[L-07] Missing check for contract existence](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-yield-findings/issues/55)

Low-level call returns success even if the contract is non-existent. This requires a contract existence check before making the low-level call ([`TimeLock.sol` L93](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-yield/blob/4dc46470e616dd0cbd9db9b4742e36c4d809e02c/contracts/utils/TimeLock.sol#L93)).


See: “The low-level functions call, `delegatecall` and `staticcall` return true as their first return value if the account called is non-existent, as part of the design of the EVM. Account existence must be checked prior to calling if needed.” from https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.7/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-require-revert-and-exceptions

Recommend checking for target contract existence before call.

## [[L-08] `_peek` does not work for tokens with > 18 decimals](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-yield-findings/issues/23)
_Submitted by cmichel_

The `CTokenMultiOracle._peek/_get` function does the following computation on unsigned integers which reverts when `source.decimals > 18`:

```solidity
price = uint(rawPrice) * 10 ** (18 - source.decimals);
```

Recommend instead performing this `price = uint(rawPrice) * 10 ** 18 / 10 ** source.decimals;`.
Note that this leads to a loss of precision and the price could end up being `0`.

_Submitted by cmichel_

The `ERC20Rewards` contract assumes that enough `rewardsToken` are in the contract to pay out when `claim` is called but this value is never checked and claiming rewards can fail.

Recommend that, when setting new rewards periods, to make sure that enough `rewardsToken`s are in the contract to cover the entire period.

## [[L-10] improve safety of role constants ](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-yield-findings/issues/9)
_Submitted by gpersoon_

The contract `Wand` defines a few role constants with `bytes4(keccak256("...function..."))`
However if the function template would change slightly, for example when `uint128` is replaced by `uint256`, then this construction isn't valid anymore.

It is safer to use the function selector, as is done in [`EmergencyBrake.sol`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-yield/blob/main/contracts/Wand.sol#L27)
```solidity
  bytes4 public constant JOIN = bytes4(keccak256("join(address,uint128)"));
  bytes4 public constant EXIT = bytes4(keccak256("exit(address,uint128)"));
  bytes4 public constant MINT = bytes4(keccak256("mint(address,uint256)"));
  bytes4 public constant BURN = bytes4(keccak256("burn(address,uint256)"));
```

```solidity
// https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-yield/blob/main/contracts/utils/EmergencyBrake.sol#L35
  _grantRole(IEmergencyBrake.plan.selector, planner);
```

Recommend using function selectors in `Wand.sol`.

## [[L-11] `EmergencyBrake.sol`: Permissions cannot be re-planned after termination](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-yield-findings/issues/21)
_Submitted by hickuphh3_

Given a configuration of target, contacts, and permissions, calling `terminate()`, will permanently prevent this configuration from being used again because the state becomes `State.TERMINATED`. All other functions require the configuration to be in the other states (UNKNOWN, PLANNED, or EXECUTED).

In other words, the removal of the restoring option for the configuration through `EmergencyBrake` is permanent.

Recommend that, since `EmergencyBrake` cannot reinstate permissions after termination, it would be better to have terminate change its state to UNKNOWN. The TERMINATED state can therefore be removed.

## [[L-12] `ERC20Rewards.sol`: Have a method to calculate the latest `rewardsPerToken` accumulated value](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-08-yield-findings/issues/57)
_Submitted by hickuphh3_

This would be equivalent to [Unipool's `rewardPerToken()` function](https://github.com/k06a/Unipool/blob/master/contracts/Unipool.sol#L69). Note that `rewardsPerToken.accumulated` only reflects the latest stored accumulated value, but does not account for pending accumulation like Unipool, and is therefore not the same. It possibly might be mistaken to be so, hence the low risk classification.

A possible implementation is given below.
```jsx
function latestRewardPerToken() external view returns (uint256) {
	RewardsPerToken memory rewardsPerToken_ = rewardsPerToken;
	if (_totalSupply == 0) return rewardsPerToken_.accumulated;
	uint32 end = earliest(block.timestamp.u32(), rewardsPeriod.end);
	uint256 timeSinceLastUpdated = end - rewardsPerToken_.lastUpdated;
	return rewardsPerToken_.accumulated + 1e18 * timeSinceLastUpdated * rewardsPerToken_.rate / _totalSupply;
}
```
