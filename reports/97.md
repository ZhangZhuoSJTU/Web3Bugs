# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Biconomy Hyphen 2.0 smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between March 10—March 16 2022.

## Wardens

61 Wardens contributed reports to the Biconomy Hyphen 2.0 contest:

Final report assembled by [liveactionllama](https://twitter.com/liveactionllama).

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 25 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 5 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 20 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 39 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 39 reports recommending gas optimizations.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Biconomy Hyphen 2.0 contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy), and is composed of 7 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 1,621 lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code4rena.com).

# High Risk Findings (5)
## [[H-01] Can deposit native token for free and steal funds](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy-findings/issues/55)
_Submitted by cmichel, also found by CertoraInc_

[LiquidityPool.sol#L151](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/db8a1fdddd02e8cc209a4c73ffbb3de210e4a81a/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityPool.sol#L151)<br>

The `depositErc20` function allows setting `tokenAddress = NATIVE` and does not throw an error.<br>
No matter the `amount` chosen, the `SafeERC20Upgradeable.safeTransferFrom(IERC20Upgradeable(tokenAddress), sender, address(this), amount);` call will not revert because it performs a low-level call to `NATIVE = 0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE`, which is an EOA, and the low-level calls to EOAs always succeed.<br>
Because the `safe*` version is used, the EOA not returning any data does not revert either.<br>

This allows an attacker to deposit infinite native tokens by not paying anything.<br>
The contract will emit the same `Deposit` event as a real `depositNative` call and the attacker receives the native funds on the other chain.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Check `tokenAddress != NATIVE` in `depositErc20`.

## [[H-02] `LiquidityProviders.sol` The share price of the LP can be manipulated and making future liquidityProviders unable to `removeLiquidity()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy-findings/issues/139)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

[LiquidityProviders.sol#L345-L362](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/04751283f85c9fc94fb644ff2b489ec339cd9ffc/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityProviders.sol#L345-L362)<br>

```solidity
function removeLiquidity(uint256 _nftId, uint256 _amount)
    external
    nonReentrant
    onlyValidLpToken(_nftId, _msgSender())
    whenNotPaused
{
    (address _tokenAddress, uint256 nftSuppliedLiquidity, uint256 totalNFTShares) = lpToken.tokenMetadata(_nftId);
    require(_isSupportedToken(_tokenAddress), "ERR__TOKEN_NOT_SUPPORTED");

    require(_amount != 0, "ERR__INVALID_AMOUNT");
    require(nftSuppliedLiquidity >= _amount, "ERR__INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY");
    whiteListPeriodManager.beforeLiquidityRemoval(_msgSender(), _tokenAddress, _amount);
    // Claculate how much shares represent input amount
    uint256 lpSharesForInputAmount = _amount * getTokenPriceInLPShares(_tokenAddress);

    // Calculate rewards accumulated
    uint256 eligibleLiquidity = sharesToTokenAmount(totalNFTShares, _tokenAddress);
```

[LiquidityProviders.sol#L192-L194](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/db8a1fdddd02e8cc209a4c73ffbb3de210e4a81a/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityProviders.sol#L192-L194)<br>

```solidity
function sharesToTokenAmount(uint256 _shares, address _tokenAddress) public view returns (uint256) {
    return (_shares * totalReserve[_tokenAddress]) / totalSharesMinted[_tokenAddress];
}
```

The share price of the liquidity can be manipulated to an extremely low value (1 underlying token worth a huge amount of shares), making it possible for `sharesToTokenAmount(totalNFTShares, _tokenAddress)` to overflow in `removeLiquidity()` and therefore freeze users' funds.

### Proof of Concept

1.  Alice `addTokenLiquidity()` with `1e8 * 1e18` XYZ on B-Chain, totalSharesMinted == `1e44`;
2.  Alice `sendFundsToUser()` and bridge `1e8 * 1e18` XYZ from B-Chain to A-Chain;
3.  Alice `depositErc20()` and bridge `1e8 * 1e18` XYZ from A-Chain to B-Chain;
4.  Alice `removeLiquidity()` and withdraw `1e8 * 1e18 - 1` XYZ, then: `totalReserve` == `1 wei` XYZ, and `totalSharesMinted` == `1e26`;
5.  Bob `addTokenLiquidity()` with `3.4e7 * 1e18` XYZ;
6.  Bob tries to `removeLiquidity()`.

Expected Results: Bob to get back the deposits;

Actual Results: The tx reverted due to overflow at `sharesToTokenAmount()`.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

[LiquidityProviders.sol#L280-L292](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/04751283f85c9fc94fb644ff2b489ec339cd9ffc/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityProviders.sol#L280-L292)<br>

```solidity
function _increaseLiquidity(uint256 _nftId, uint256 _amount) internal onlyValidLpToken(_nftId, _msgSender()) {
    (address token, uint256 totalSuppliedLiquidity, uint256 totalShares) = lpToken.tokenMetadata(_nftId);

    require(_amount > 0, "ERR__AMOUNT_IS_0");
    whiteListPeriodManager.beforeLiquidityAddition(_msgSender(), token, _amount);

    uint256 mintedSharesAmount;
    // Adding liquidity in the pool for the first time
    if (totalReserve[token] == 0) {
        mintedSharesAmount = BASE_DIVISOR * _amount;
    } else {
        mintedSharesAmount = (_amount * totalSharesMinted[token]) / totalReserve[token];
    }
    ...
```

Consider locking part of the first mint's liquidity to maintain a minimum amount of `totalReserve[token]`, so that the share price can not be easily manipulated.

## [[H-03] Wrong formula when add fee `incentivePool` can lead to loss of funds.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy-findings/issues/38)
_Submitted by minhquanym, also found by cmichel, hickuphh3, and WatchPug_

[LiquidityPool.sol#L319-L322](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/db8a1fdddd02e8cc209a4c73ffbb3de210e4a81a/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityPool.sol#L319-L322)<br>

The `getAmountToTransfer` function of `LiquidityPool` updates `incentivePool[tokenAddress]` by adding some fee to it but the formula is wrong and the value of `incentivePool[tokenAddress]` will be divided by `BASE_DIVISOR` (10000000000) each time.
After just a few time, the value of `incentivePool[tokenAddress]` will become zero and that amount of `tokenAddress` token will be locked in contract.

### Proof of concept

Line 319-322

    incentivePool[tokenAddress] = (incentivePool[tokenAddress] + (amount * (transferFeePerc - tokenManager.getTokensInfo(tokenAddress).equilibriumFee))) / BASE_DIVISOR;

Let `x = incentivePool[tokenAddress]`, `y = amount`, `z = transferFeePerc` and `t = tokenManager.getTokensInfo(tokenAddress).equilibriumFee`. Then that be written as

    x = (x + (y * (z - t))) / BASE_DIVISOR;
    x = x / BASE_DIVISOR + (y * (z - t)) / BASE_DIVISOR;

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Fix the bug by changing lines 319-322 to:

    incentivePool[tokenAddress] += (amount * (transferFeePerc - tokenManager.getTokensInfo(tokenAddress).equilibriumFee)) / BASE_DIVISOR;

## [[H-04] Deleting `nft Info` can cause users' `nft.unpaidRewards` to be permanently erased](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy-findings/issues/135)

```solidity
function _sendRewardsForNft(uint256 _nftId, address payable _to) internal {

            uint256 balance = address(this).balance;
            if (pending > balance) {
                unchecked {
                    nft.unpaidRewards = pending - balance;
                }
                (bool success, ) = _to.call{value: balance}("");
                require(success, "ERR__NATIVE_TRANSFER_FAILED");
                amountSent = balance;
            } else {
                nft.unpaidRewards = 0;
                (bool success, ) = _to.call{value: pending}("");
                require(success, "ERR__NATIVE_TRANSFER_FAILED");
                amountSent = pending;
            }
        } else {
            IERC20Upgradeable rewardToken = IERC20Upgradeable(rewardTokens[baseToken]);
            uint256 balance = rewardToken.balanceOf(address(this));
            if (pending > balance) {
                unchecked {
                    nft.unpaidRewards = pending - balance;
                }
                amountSent = _sendErc20AndGetSentAmount(rewardToken, balance, _to);
            } else {
                nft.unpaidRewards = 0;
                amountSent = _sendErc20AndGetSentAmount(rewardToken, pending, _to);
            }
        }
    }
    nft.rewardDebt = (amount * pool.accTokenPerShare) / ACC_TOKEN_PRECISION;
    emit LogOnReward(_msgSender(), baseToken, amountSent, _to);
}
```

When `withdraw()` is called, `_sendRewardsForNft(_nftId, _to)` will be called to send the rewards.

In `_sendRewardsForNft()`, when `address(this).balance` is insufficient at the moment, `nft.unpaidRewards = pending - balance` will be recorded and the user can get it back at the next time.

However, at L244, the whole `nftInfo` is being deleted, so that `nft.unpaidRewards` will also get erased.

There is no way for the user to get back this `unpaidRewards` anymore.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider adding a new parameter named `force` for `withdraw()`, `require(force || unpaidRewards == 0)` before deleting nftInfo.

I would argue, the user's assets at this point in time DO include all unpaid rewards, so it is perfectly reasonable to treat this as high risk.

 > Agree that the boundaries are not very clear, this issue might fall somewhere between Medium and High severities. But my initial thought was similar to that of @0xleastwood, the rewards already belong to the user, and losing them will make the user lose on time and other opportunities. Also, this is not a hypothetical attack scenario, but a very real valid execution path, thus I think a high severity is fine here.

## [[H-05] Users will lose a majority or even all of the rewards when the amount of total shares is too large, due to precision loss](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy-findings/issues/140)

    mintedSharesAmount = BASE_DIVISOR * _amount;
} else {
    mintedSharesAmount = (_amount * totalSharesMinted[token]) / totalReserve[token];
}
```

In `HyphenLiquidityFarming`, the `accTokenPerShare` is calculated based on the total staked shares.

However, as the `mintedSharesAmount` can easily become very large on `LiquidityProviders.sol`, all the users can lose their rewards due to precision loss.

### Proof of Concept

Given:

*   rewardsPerSecond is `10e18`;
*   lastRewardTime is 24 hrs ago;

Then:

1.  Alice `addTokenLiquidity()` with `1e8 * 1e18` XYZ on B-Chain, totalSharesMinted == `1e44`;
2.  Alice `deposit()` to HyphenLiquidityFarming, totalSharesStaked == `1e44`;
3.  24 hrs later, Alice tries to claim the rewards.

`accumulator = rewardsPerSecond * 24 hours` == 864000e18 == 8.64e23

Expected Results: As the sole staker, Alice should get all the `864000e18` rewards.

Actual Results: Alice received 0 rewards.

That's because when `totalSharesStaked > 1e36`, `accumulator = (accumulator * ACC_TOKEN_PRECISION) / totalSharesStaked[_baseToken];` will be round down to `0`.

When the `totalSharesStaked` is large enough, all users will lose their rewards due to precision loss.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

1.  Consider lowering the `BASE_DIVISOR` so that the initial share price can be higher;
2.  Consider making `ACC_TOKEN_PRECISION` larger to prevent precision loss;

Supported tokens can be turned off again by calling `TokenManager.removeSupportedToken`.<br>
Users won't be able to withdraw their liquidity anymore because of [this check](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/db8a1fdddd02e8cc209a4c73ffbb3de210e4a81a/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityProviders.sol#L352) in `removeLiquidity`.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider allowing withdrawals even if the token was unsupported to allow users to reclaim their funds.

## [[M-02] A `pauser` can brick the contracts](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy-findings/issues/137)
_Submitted by WatchPug, also found by JMukesh, peritoflores, and whilom_

[Pausable.sol#L65-L68](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/db8a1fdddd02e8cc209a4c73ffbb3de210e4a81a/contracts/security/Pausable.sol#L65-L68)<br>

```solidity
    function renouncePauser() external virtual onlyPauser {
        emit PauserChanged(_pauser, address(0));
        _pauser = address(0);
    }
```

A malicious or compromised `pauser` can call `pause()` and `renouncePauser()` to brick the contract and all the funds can be frozen.

### Proof of Concept

Given:

*   Alice (EOA) is the `pauser` of the contract.

1.  Alice calls `pause()` ;
2.  Alice calls `renouncePauser()`;

As a result, most of the contract's methods are now unavailable, and this cannot be reversed even by the `owner`.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider removing `renouncePauser()`, or requiring the contract not in `paused` mode when `renouncePauser()`.

 > A valid concern, however, the proposed solution has drawbacks too. If you change from onlyPauser to onlyOwner here, a compromise of the owner account will have devastating consequences while with the current implementation the pauser can still pause the contracts independently of an owner. So this is a double-edged sword, it is up to you to decide which way is more acceptable.

## [[M-03] Incompatibility With Rebasing/Deflationary/Inflationary token](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy-findings/issues/91)
_Submitted by Jujic, also found by cmichel, defsec, hagrid, hickuphh3, IllIllI, minhquanym, Ruhum, and shenwilly_

The scope contracts do not appear to support rebasing/deflationary/inflationary tokens whose balance changes during transfers or over time. The necessary checks include at least verifying the amount of tokens transferred to contracts before and after the actual transfer to infer any fees/interest.

### Proof of Concept

[TokenManager.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/main/contracts/hyphen/token/TokenManager.sol)<br>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Make sure token vault accounts for any rebasing/inflation/deflation.<br>
Add support in contracts for such tokens before accepting user-supplied tokens.

Owners have full control over the protocol.

### Proof of Concept

Owners have full control over:

*   executors who perform token transfers on behalf of the destination chain
*   reclaiming / withdrawing any tokens (including reward tokens) held by farming contract
*   total upgradeability
*   instant parameters change (no timelock)
*   1 step owner change (gold standard is 2-step owner change)

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Make executors decentralized.<br>
Add TimeLock for parameter changes.

## [[M-05] Frontrunning of `setPerTokenWalletCap` edge case](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy-findings/issues/158)
_Submitted by sirhashalot_

The `setPerTokenWalletCap()` function in WhitelistPeriodManager.sol [contains a comment](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/04751283f85c9fc94fb644ff2b489ec339cd9ffc/contracts/hyphen/WhitelistPeriodManager.sol#L196-L200) stating:

    Special care must be taken when calling this function
    There are no checks for _perTokenWalletCap (since it's onlyOwner), but it's essential that it should be >= max lp provided by an lp.
    Checking this on chain will probably require implementing a bbst, which needs more bandwidth
    Call the view function getMaxCommunityLpPositon() separately before changing this value

Even if the manual step of calling the `getMaxCommunityLpPositon()` function is properly performed, it is possible for a user to add liquidity to increase the `maxLp` value in between when the `getMaxCommunityLpPositon()` function is called and when the `setPerTokenWalletCap()` function is called. Because this process is manual, this doesn't need to be bot frontrunning in the same block as when the `setPerTokenWalletCap()` function is called, but can be cause by poor timing of an innocent unknowing user adding liquidity to the protocol. If this condition occurs, the liquidity provider will have provided more liquidity than the perTokenWalletCap limit, breaking the assumptions for this variable and leading to some denial of service conditions.

This edge situation can impact the `setTotalCap()` function and the "perTokenTotalCap\[\_token]" state variable as well, but the "perTokenWalletCap\[\_token]" value would have to be reduced before the "perTokenTotalCap\[\_token]" value is reduced. The impact to `setTotalCap()` follows the same execution path but adds the additional step of calling the `setTotalCap()` function at the end of the process.

### Proof of Concept

1.  Owner [calls `getMaxCommunityLpPositon(_token)` function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/04751283f85c9fc94fb644ff2b489ec339cd9ffc/contracts/hyphen/WhitelistPeriodManager.sol#L245-L255) to identify maxLp value to confirm new perTokenWalletCap value is below maxLp value
2.  An innocent user adds liquidity to their position without the knowledge that the owner is going to reduce the "perTokenWalletCap\[\_token]" value soon
3.  Owner [calls `setPerTokenWalletCap()` function ](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/04751283f85c9fc94fb644ff2b489ec339cd9ffc/contracts/hyphen/WhitelistPeriodManager.sol#L202-L208)to reduce "perTokenWalletCap\[\_token]" value
4.  The innocent user has more liquidity than the new "perTokenWalletCap\[\_token]" value. This means that the user can be in a situation where if they remove x amount of liquidity and attempt to add x liquidity back to their position, the innocent user will be unable to do so. Other functions that rely on the assumption that the largest user deposit is below the "perTokenWalletCap\[\_token]" value may break due to incorrect assumptions

This edge situation can impact the `setTotalCap()` function and the "perTokenTotalCap\[\_token]" state variable as well, but the "perTokenWalletCap\[\_token]" value would have to be reduced before the "perTokenTotalCap\[\_token]" value is reduced. The impact to `setTotalCap()` follows the same execution path but adds the additional step of calling the `setTotalCap()` function at the end of the process.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

A programmatic solution is the only way to avoid these edge case scenarios, though it will increase gas consumption. To convert the manual calling of `getMaxCommunityLpPositon(_token)` to a programmatic solution, add the following require statement next to the existing require statement of the `setPerTokenWalletCap()` function:<br>
`require(_perTokenWalletCap <= getMaxCommunityLpPositon(_token), "ERR_PWC_GT_MCLP");`

## [[M-07] Sending tokens close to the maximum will fail and user will lose tokens](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy-findings/issues/181)
_Submitted by pedroais, also found by WatchPug_

[LiquidityPool.sol#L171](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/04751283f85c9fc94fb644ff2b489ec339cd9ffc/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityPool.sol#L171)<br>

When a user calls the deposit function the reward amount is calculated and an event is emited with amount+reward as the transfer amount. The function checks amount is smaller than the max amount.

An executor then listens to this event and calls sendFundsToUser with rewards + amount as the amount parameter. This function checks amount+reward is smaller than max amount.

This is a problem because the amount transferred may be in the limit but amount + reward could pass the limit and the executor won't be able to send the transaction. The user will lose the funds. Both checks should be made with the reward or without the reward but the checks should be the same for this not to happen.

Step by step :<br>
Max transfer is set to 50 for token A<br>
Bob transfers 49 tokens, this will pass since 49<50. The reward is calculated in 2 tokens.<br>
The executor then calls sendFundsToUser with 52. This transaction will revert and user will lose their tokens.<br>

This value of amount includes rewards but the previous check didn't include rewards: [LiquidityPool.sol#L273](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/04751283f85c9fc94fb644ff2b489ec339cd9ffc/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityPool.sol#L273).

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Both checks should be made over the same amount = amount + rewards

## [[M-08] Incentive Pool can be drained without rebalancing the pool](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy-findings/issues/87)
_Submitted by kyliek, also found by Ruhum and WatchPug_

[LiquidityPool.sol#L149-L173](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/04751283f85c9fc94fb644ff2b489ec339cd9ffc/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityPool.sol#L149-L173)<br>

`depositErc20` allows an attacker to specify the destination chain to be the same as the source chain and the receiver account to be the same as the caller account. This enables an attacker to drain the incentive pool without rebalancing the pool back to the equilibrium state.

### Proof of Concept

This requires the attacker to have some collateral, to begin with. The profit also depends on how much the attacker has. Assume the attacker has enough assets.

In each chain, when the pool is very deficit (e.g. `currentLiquidity` is much less than `providedLiquidity`), which often mean there's a good amount in the Incentive pool after some high valued transfers, then do the following.

*   step 1 :  borrow the liquidityDifference amount such that one can get the whole incentivePool.

<!---->

                uint256 liquidityDifference = providedLiquidity - currentLiquidity;
                if (amount >= liquidityDifference) {
                    rewardAmount = incentivePool[tokenAddress];

*   step 2 : call `depositErc20()` with `toChainId` being the same chain and `receiver` being `msg.sender`.

The executor will call `sendFundsToUser` to msg.sender. Then a rewardAmount, equivalent to the entire incentive pool (up to 10% of the total pool value), will be added to `msg.sender` minus equilibrium fee (\~0.01%) and gas fee.

In the end, the pool is back to the deficit state as before, the incentive pool is drained and the exploiter pockets the difference of rewardAmount minus fees.

This attack can be repeated on each deployed chain multiple times whenever the incentive pool is profitable (particularly right after a big transfer).

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

*   Disallow `toChainId` to be the source chain by validating it in `depositErc20` or in `sendFundsToUser` validate that `fromChainId` is not the same as current chain.

*   Require `receiver` is not `msg.sender` in `depositErc20`.

 > If depositor keeps toChainId same as source chain Id, then executor will not pick this deposit transaction on backend as there won't be any mapping for fromChainId => toChainId, so depositor funds will remain in the source chain if he tries to do it and try to drain the incentive pool.

## [[M-09] Improper Upper Bound Definition on the Fee](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy-findings/issues/8)
_Submitted by defsec, also found by catchup, danb, Dravee, gzeon, hickuphh3, hubble, peritoflores, Ruhum, and throttle_

The **equilibriumFee** and **maxFee** does not have any upper or lower bounds. Values that are too large will lead to reversions in several critical functions or the LP user will lost all funds when paying the fee.

### Proof of Concept

1.  Navigate to the following contract.

[TokenManager.sol#L52](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/db8a1fdddd02e8cc209a4c73ffbb3de210e4a81a/contracts/hyphen/token/TokenManager.sol#L52)<br>

2.  Owner can identify fee amount. That directly affect to LP management. [LiquidityPool.sol#L352](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/db8a1fdddd02e8cc209a4c73ffbb3de210e4a81a/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityPool.sol#L352)

3.  Here you can see there is no upper bound has been defined.

```
    function changeFee(
        address tokenAddress,
        uint256 _equilibriumFee,
        uint256 _maxFee
    ) external override onlyOwner whenNotPaused {
        require(_equilibriumFee != 0, "Equilibrium Fee cannot be 0");
        require(_maxFee != 0, "Max Fee cannot be 0");
        tokensInfo[tokenAddress].equilibriumFee = _equilibriumFee;
        tokensInfo[tokenAddress].maxFee = _maxFee;
        emit FeeChanged(tokenAddress, tokensInfo[tokenAddress].equilibriumFee, tokensInfo[tokenAddress].maxFee);
    }

```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider defining upper and lower bounds on the **equilibriumFee** and **maxFee**.

Low level calls (call, delegate call and static call) return success if the called contract doesn’t exist (not deployed or destructed).

This makes a user be able to send his funds to non-existing addresses.

`LiquidityFarming`<br>
`reclaimTokens` - if the owner calls by accident with a non-existing address he'll lose the funds.<br>
`_sendRewardsForNft` - if the `withdraw` or `extractRewards` will be called with a `to` non-existing address, the funds will be lost. That's because of the call to `_sendRewardsForNft` which contains a low level call to the `to` address.<br>

`sendFundsToUser` - if an executor calls by accident with a non-existing address the funds will be lost.<br>
`transfer` - if the `transfer` function will be called (by the LiquidityProvidors contract of course) with a non existing address as a receiver, the funds will be lost.<br>

## [[M-11] `LiquidityProviders`: Setting new liquidity pool will break contract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy-findings/issues/52)

Owners can change the `liquidityPool` variable any time with the `setLiquidityPool` function.<br>
If a liquidity pool was already set and users added liquidity with `addTokenLiquidity`, the tokens are directly transferred to the liquidity pool and not kept in the `LiquidityProviders` contract.<br>
Changing the `liquidityPool` to a different contract will make it impossible for the users to withdraw their liquidity using `removeLiquidity` because the tokens are still in the old `liquidityPool` and cannot be retrieved.<br>

All users will lose their funds.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Changing the `liquidityPool` requires a sophisticated migration mechanism.<br>
Only allow setting the `liquidityPool` contract once.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Changing the `lpToken` requires a sophisticated migration mechanism.<br>
Only allow setting the `lpToken` contract once.

## [[M-13] Improper `tokenGasPrice` design can overcharge user for the gas cost by a huge margin](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy-findings/issues/145)
_Submitted by WatchPug, also found by cmichel and hyh_

[LiquidityPool.sol#L330-L337](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/04751283f85c9fc94fb644ff2b489ec339cd9ffc/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityPool.sol#L330-L337)<br>

```solidity
uint256 totalGasUsed = initialGas - gasleft();
totalGasUsed = totalGasUsed + tokenManager.getTokensInfo(tokenAddress).transferOverhead;
totalGasUsed = totalGasUsed + baseGas;

uint256 gasFee = totalGasUsed * tokenGasPrice;
gasFeeAccumulatedByToken[tokenAddress] = gasFeeAccumulatedByToken[tokenAddress] + gasFee;
gasFeeAccumulated[tokenAddress][_msgSender()] = gasFeeAccumulated[tokenAddress][_msgSender()] + gasFee;
amountToTransfer = amount - (transferFeeAmount + gasFee);
```

When the `Executor` calls `sendFundsToUser()`, the `tokenGasPrice` will be used to calculate the gas fee for this transaction and it will be deducted from the transfer amount.

However, since `tokenGasPrice` is `uint256`, the smallest chargeable amount is `1 wei` Token for `1 gas`. But there are tokens like `WBTC` (decimals = 8) or `USDC` (decimals = 6), for these tokens, even `1 wei` of the token can be worth a lot of gas, if the `tokenGasPrice` is set to `1`, `gasFee` will far more than the actual cost; if it's set to `0`, `gasFee` can only be `0`.

### Proof of Concept

Given:

*   `baseGas` = 21000
*   `tokenGasPrice` for WBTC = `1 wei`
*   `transferFeeAmount` = 0
*   1 WBTC = 20,000 MATIC

1.  Alice send `0.1 WBTC` to Bob's address on Polygon
2.  `Executor` calls `sendFundsToUser()` with `tokenGasPrice` = `1` on Polygon, `totalGasUsed` = `42000` and the gas price is `30G wei`, `Executor` paid `0.00126 MATIC` for gas.

```solidity
uint256 gasFee = 42000 * 1;
...
amountToTransfer = 10000000 - (0 + 42000);
```

3.  Bob received 0.09958 WBTC, and paid `0.00042 WBTC` for the gas, the gas fee was overcharged by 6666 times.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider changing `tokenGasPrice` to a value with decimals of `18` and it should be used like this:

```solidity
uint256 gasFee = totalGasUsed * tokenGasPrice / 1e18;
```

## [[M-14] `LiquidityFarming.sol` Unbounded for loops can potentially freeze users' funds in edge cases](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy-findings/issues/136)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

In the current implementation of `withdraw()`, it calls `_sendRewardsForNft()` at L243 which calls `updatePool()` at L129 which calls `getUpdatedAccTokenPerShare()` at L319.

`getUpdatedAccTokenPerShare()` will loop over `rewardRateLog` to calculate an up to date value of accTokenPerShare.

[LiquidityFarming.sol#L270-L285](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/db8a1fdddd02e8cc209a4c73ffbb3de210e4a81a/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityFarming.sol#L270-L285)<br>

```solidity
while (true) {
    if (lastUpdatedTime >= counter) {
        break;
    }
    unchecked {
        accumulator +=
            rewardRateLog[_baseToken][i].rewardsPerSecond *
            (counter - max(lastUpdatedTime, rewardRateLog[_baseToken][i].timestamp));
    }
    counter = rewardRateLog[_baseToken][i].timestamp;
    if (i == 0) {
        break;
    }
    --i;
}
```

This won't be a problem in the usual cases, however, if there is a baseToken that:

*   the `rewardPerSecond` get updated quite frequently;
*   the liquidityProviders are inactive (no deposits / withdrawals for a period of time)

Then by the time one of the `liquidityProviders` come to `withdraw()`, the tx may revert due to out-of-gas.

As the `rewardRateLog` is now accumulated to a large size that causes the loop costs more gas than the block gas limit.

There is a really easy fix for this, it will also make the code simpler:

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider removing `rewardRateLog` and change `setRewardPerSecond()` to:

```solidity
function setRewardPerSecond(address _baseToken, uint256 _rewardPerSecond) public onlyOwner {
    updatePool(baseToken);
    rewardRate[_baseToken] = RewardsPerSecondEntry(_rewardPerSecond, block.timestamp);
    emit LogRewardPerSecond(_baseToken, _rewardPerSecond);
}
```

## [[M-15] `WhitelistPeriodManager`: Improper state handling of exclusion removals](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy-findings/issues/72)
_Submitted by hickuphh3, also found by throttle_

[WhitelistPeriodManager.sol#L178-L184](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/main/contracts/hyphen/WhitelistPeriodManager.sol#L178-L184)<br>
[WhitelistPeriodManager.sol#L115-L125](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/main/contracts/hyphen/WhitelistPeriodManager.sol#L115-L125)<br>

The `totalLiquidity` and `totalLiquidityByLp` mappings are not updated when an address is removed from the `isExcludedAddress` mapping. While this affects the enforcement of the cap limits and the `getMaxCommunityLpPositon()` function, the worst impact this has is that the address cannot have liquidity removed / transferred due to subtraction overflow.

In particular, users can be prevented from withdrawing their staked LP tokens from the liquidity farming contract should it become non-excluded.

### Proof of Concept

*   Assume liquidity farming address `0xA` is excluded
*   Bob stakes his LP token
*   Liquidity farming contract is no longer to be excluded: `setIsExcludedAddressStatus([0xA, false])`
*   Bob attempts to withdraw liquidity → reverts because `totalLiquidityByLp[USDC][0xA] = 0`, resulting in subtraction overflow.

```jsx
// insert test case in Withdraw test block of LiquidityFarming.tests.ts
it.only('will brick withdrawals by no longer excluding farming contract', async () => {
  await farmingContract.deposit(1, bob.address);
  await wlpm.setIsExcludedAddressStatus([farmingContract.address], [false]);
  await farmingContract.connect(bob).withdraw(1, bob.address);
});

// results in
// Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: reverted with panic code 0x11 (Arithmetic operation underflowed or overflowed outside of an unchecked block)
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The simplest way is to prevent exclusion removals.

```jsx
function setIsExcludedAddresses(address[] memory _addresses) external onlyOwner {
  for (uint256 i = 0; i < _addresses.length; ++i) {
    isExcludedAddress[_addresses[i]] = true;
    // emit event
    emit AddressExcluded(_addresses[i]);
  }
}
```

## [[M-16] `WhitelistPeriodManager`: Improper state handling of exclusion additions](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy-findings/issues/75)
_Submitted by hickuphh3_

[WhitelistPeriodManager.sol#L178-L184](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/main/contracts/hyphen/WhitelistPeriodManager.sol#L178-L184)<br>

The `totalLiquidity` and `totalLiquidityByLp` mappings are not updated when an address is added to the `isExcludedAddress` mapping. This affects the enforcement of the cap limits and the `getMaxCommunityLpPositon()` function, which implicitly assumes that whitelisted addresses will have 0 liquidity, for addresses with non-zero liquidity at the time of addition to the whitelist.

### Proof of Concept

*   Assume the following initial conditions:
    *   Alice’s address `0xA` is the sole USDC liquidity provider
        *   `totalLiquidity[USDC] = 500`
        *   `totalLiquidity[USDC][0xA] = 500`
    *   USDC total cap of `500`, ie. `perTokenTotalCap[USDC] = 500`
*   Exclude Alice’s address `0xA`: `setIsExcludedAddressStatus([0xA, true])`
    *   totalLiquidity mappings are unchanged
*   The following deviant behaviour is observed:
    *   `getMaxCommunityLpPositon()` returns `500` when it should return `0`
    *   All non-excluded addresses are unable to provide liquidity when they should have been able to, as Alice’s liquidity should have been excluded.
    ```jsx
    // insert test case in WhitelistPeriodManager.test.ts
    describe.only("Test whitelist addition", async () => {
      it('produces deviant behaviour if excluding address with existing liquidity', async () => {
        await wlpm.setCaps([token.address], [500], [500]);
        await liquidityProviders.connect(owner).addTokenLiquidity(token.address, 500);
        await wlpm.setIsExcludedAddressStatus([owner.address], [true]);
        // 1) returns 500 instead of 0
        console.log((await wlpm.getMaxCommunityLpPositon(token.address)).toString());
        // 2) bob (or other non-excluded addresses) will be unable to add liquidity
        await expect(liquidityProviders.connect(bob).addTokenLiquidity(token.address, 1)).to.be.revertedWith('ERR__LIQUIDITY_EXCEEDS_PTTC');
      });
    });
    ```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Check that the address to be excluded is not holding any LP token at the time of exclusion.

```jsx
// in setIsExcludedAddressStatus()
for (uint256 i = 0; i < _addresses.length; ++i) {
  if (_status[i]) {
    require(lpToken.balanceOf(_addresses[i]) == 0, 'address has existing liquidity');
  }
  ...
}

## [[M-17] wrong condition checking in price calculation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy-findings/issues/105)
_Submitted by CertoraInc_

[LiquidityProviders.sol#L180-L186](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/04751283f85c9fc94fb644ff2b489ec339cd9ffc/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityProviders.sol#L180-L186)<br>

The `getTokenPriceInLPShares` function calculates the token price in LP shares, but it checks a wrong condition - if supposed to return `BASE_DIVISOR` if the total reserve is zero, not if the total shares minted is zero. This might leads to a case where the price is calculated incorrectly, or a division by zero is happening.

### Proof of Concept

This is the wrong function implementation:

```sol
function getTokenPriceInLPShares(address _baseToken) public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 supply = totalSharesMinted[_baseToken];
    if (supply > 0) {
        return totalSharesMinted[_baseToken] / totalReserve[_baseToken];
    }
    return BASE_DIVISOR;
}
```

This function is used in this contract only in the removeLiquidity and claimFee function, so it's called only if funds were already deposited and totalReserve is not zero, but it can be problematic when other contracts will use this function (it's a public view function so it might get called from outside of the contract).

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The correct code should be:

```sol
function getTokenPriceInLPShares(address _baseToken) public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 reserve = totalReserve[_baseToken];
    if (reserve > 0) {
        return totalSharesMinted[_baseToken] / totalReserve[_baseToken];
    }
    return BASE_DIVISOR;
}
```

## [[M-18]  Possible frontrun on deposits on `LiquidityPool`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy-findings/issues/180)
*Submitted by Cantor_Dust, also found by WatchPug*

Rewards are given to a user for depositing either ERC20 tokens or their native token into the LiquidityPool. This reward is used to incentivize users to deposit funds into the liquidity pool when the pool is not in an equilibrium state.

For regular users, this liquidity pool state fluctuates based on the frequency and amount of deposits made to the liquidity pool. If a malicious user can control the state of the liquidity pool before a victim deposits tokens into the liquidity pool, they can gain double rewards.

To gain these double rewards, a malicious user can watch the mempool for transactions that will receive a reward when the deposit occurs. When a malicious user sees that victim deposit, the malicious user can attach a higher fee to their transaction and initiate a deposit. This will allow the malicious user's transaction to front-run before the victim's transaction.

Once the malicious user's deposit is complete, the liquidity pool state will be in a near equilibrium state. Then, the victim's deposit will occur which causes the liquidity pool state to no longer be in equilibrium.

Finally, the malicious user will make a final deposit gaining yet another reward for bringing the liquidity pool state back to equilibrium.

To sum up, a malicious user can create a sandwich attack where they deposit their own tokens before and after a victim's transaction. This will allow the malicious user to double dip and gain rewards twice due to victim's deposit.

### Proof of Concept

Let's look at the depositNative function which is the simpler of the two deposit functions.

The key component in the depositNative function is the getRewardAmount which can be found [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/main/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityPool.sol#L255). The getRewardAmount calculates how much available vs supplied liquidity exists in the liquidity pool. [Here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/main/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityPool.sol#L175-L188) there are no time-weighted checks to calculate the available vs. supplied liquidity. With a lack of checks for time-weight and that there are no frontrun checks against deposits, it's trivial to front-run deposits and control the liquidity of the liquidity such that the reward amount can be double-dipped.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

1.  By allowing each deposit to manipulate the liquidity pool state from either a deficient or excessive state, malicious users can double dip on rewards.
2.  Alternative approaches to calculating rewards is possible, for example a dutch auction style deposit system where rewards are distributed evenly could reduce an impact of a frontrun attack.
3.  A simpler approach is to record liquidity states at specific block timestamps and check against the timestamp for the current block state.

The public `sharesToTokenAmount` function does not check if the denominator `totalSharesMinted[_tokenAddress]` is zero.<br>
Neither do the callers of this function. The function will revert.<br>

## [[M-20] Liquidity providers unable to remove liquidity when the pool is in deficit state](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy-findings/issues/93)
_Submitted by kyliek_

[LiquidityProviders.sol#L388](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/04751283f85c9fc94fb644ff2b489ec339cd9ffc/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityProviders.sol#L388)<br>
[LiquidityProviders.sol#L392](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/04751283f85c9fc94fb644ff2b489ec339cd9ffc/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityProviders.sol#L392)<br>

LP token holders can not redeem their tokens when the pool is in the deficit state, i.e. `currentLiquidity << providedLiquidity`. This is due to that LP shares are computed based on `providedLiquidity` and the actual available pool balance is based on `currentLiquidity`.

### Proof of Concept

When a high valued withdrawal happens in the liquidity pool of the destination chain, the current liquidity will be reduced when the executor calls `sendFundsToUser`<br>
[LiquidityPool.sol#L285](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/04751283f85c9fc94fb644ff2b489ec339cd9ffc/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityPool.sol#L285)<br>

and the pool contract balance will also be reduced by the same amount. The pool reached a deficit state with provided liquidity much bigger than current liquidity.

The LP shares are computed based on the value of `totalReserve` that is roughly equivalent to `totalLiquidity + LpFees`. In a deficit state, `totalReserve` could be much bigger than the available pool balance (up to 90% since max fee is 10%).
If the LP token holder wants to redeem his shares,

            _decreaseCurrentLiquidity(_tokenAddress, _amount);

will underflow and revert and

            _transferFromLiquidityPool(_tokenAddress, _msgSender(), amountToWithdraw);

will revert because there is not enough balance.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

This is a tricky problem. On one hand, separating `currentLiquidity` from `providedLiquidity` made sure that by bridging tokens over, it will not inflate or deflate the pool. On the other hand, decoupling the two made it hard to compute the actual available liquidity to redeem LP shares. One may need to think through this a bit more.

## Codebase Impressions & Summary

Overall, code quality for the Hyphen 2.0 contracts is high. Supporting documentation was adequate in helping to understand the incentive and fee mechanisms for cross-chain transfers.

The contracts in scope have 81.36% statement and 54.91% branch test coverage. Notably, the Liquidity Pool’s `permitAndDepositErc20()` and `permitEIP2612AndDepositErc20()` functions that allow users to deposit with signed messages are untested. It will be ideal to write more tests so that better coverage is achieved. Also note that some liquidity farming tests often fail because rewards are continuously accruing, so the actual amount tends to be greater than the expected amount.

## [L-01] Conflicting values of `BASE_DIVISOR`

### Line References

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/main/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityPool.sol#L20>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/main/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityProviders.sol#L27>

### Description

`BASE_DIVISOR` is `10_000_000_000` in `LiquidityPool`, but `10**18` in `LiquidityProviders`. This can easily confuse 3rd parties integrating the token bridge.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Rename either variable. I recommend renaming the instance in `LiquidityPool` to `FEE_DIVISOR`.

## [L-02] Sub-optimal calculations in `getAmountToTransfer()` results in wei losses

### Line References

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/main/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityPool.sol#L317-L322>

### Description

In the scenario where the transfer fee exceeds the equilibrium fee, the excess gets credited to the incentive pool. Disregarding from the fact that a bracket is incorrectly placed causing a massive loss in incentives (raised in separate issue), there are cases where 1 wei is unaccounted for from precision loss in the calculation.

```jsx
lpFee = (amount * tokenManager.getTokensInfo(tokenAddress).equilibriumFee) / BASE_DIVISOR;
// altered for bracket positioning
incentivePool[tokenAddress] +=
  (amount * (transferFeePerc - tokenManager.getTokensInfo(tokenAddress).equilibriumFee)) /
  BASE_DIVISOR;
```

### Proof of Concept

*   `amount = 337671308498`
*   `transferFeePerc = 181480242`
*   `equilibriumFee = 10000000` (0.1%)

Calculated amounts are

*   `lpFee = 337671308`
*   `incentive = 337671308498 * (181480242 - 10000000) / BASE_DIVISOR = 5790395769`

Total fee calculated = `337671308` + `5790395769` = `6128067077`

*   `transferFeeAmount = 337671308498 * 181480242 / BASE_DIVISOR = 6128067078`

We therefore see 1 wei being unaccounted for.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

```jsx
uint256 transferFeeAmount = (amount * transferFeePerc) / BASE_DIVISOR;
uint256 lpFee;
uint256 equilibriumFee = tokenManager.getTokensInfo(tokenAddress).equilibriumFee;
if (transferFeePerc > equilibriumFee) {
  lpFee = amount * equilibriumFee / BASE_DIVISOR;
  incentivePool[tokenAddress] += transferFeeAmount - lpFee;
} else {
...
}
```

## [L-03] Unbounded iterations for `getMaxCommunityLpPositon()`

### Line References

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/main/contracts/hyphen/WhitelistPeriodManager.sol#L248>

### Description

The `getMaxCommunityLpPosition()` iterates through the LP token supply to obtain the maximum community LP position obtained. Because the supply of NFT tokens is uncapped, there will come a point where this function runs out of gas.

### Proof of Concept

In the worst case, the limit seems to be at about 1250 NFTs where the (N+1)th LP token has more liquidity than the Nth LP token.

```jsx
it.only("Tries to get max iterations possible for getMaxCommunityLpPositon()", async () => {
  let MAX_LOOPS = 1250;
  // summation formula for 1 to MAX_LOOPS
  let maxCap = MAX_LOOPS * (MAX_LOOPS + 1) / 2; 
  await wlpm.setCaps([token.address], [maxCap], [maxCap]);
  for (let i = 1; i <= MAX_LOOPS; i++) {
    console.log(`adding ${i}`);
    // worst case: every iteration in getMaxCommunityLpPositon() enters if case
    // by giving next tokenId more liquidity
    await liquidityProviders.connect(owner).addTokenLiquidity(token.address, i);
  }
  console.log('getting max lp position...');
  // Runs out of gas
  // Error: Transaction reverted and Hardhat couldn't infer the reason. Please report this to help us improve Hardhat.
  await wlpm.getMaxCommunityLpPositon(token.address);
});
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Have start and end indexes as inputs to cap the number of iterations performed.

## [L-04] `addSupportedToken()` allows zero fees to be set, but `changeFee()` doesn’t

### Line References

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/main/contracts/hyphen/token/TokenManager.sol#L49-L53>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/main/contracts/hyphen/token/TokenManager.sol#L91-L98>

### Description

As per the title, the `addSupportedToken()` allows for zero `equilibriumFee` or `maxFee` to be set, but `changeFee()` doesn’t.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Either include non-zero checks in `addSupportedToken()` or remove them in `changeFee()`.

## [L-05] `_sendErc20AndGetSentAmount()` uses recipient instead of sender balance difference

### Line References

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/main/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityFarming.sol#L109-L117>

### Description

The function name implies that the sent amount should be returned, but it uses the amount received by the recipient instead.

```jsx
uint256 recepientBalance = _token.balanceOf(_to);
_token.safeTransfer(_to, _amount);
return _token.balanceOf(_to) - recepientBalance;
```

If a fee-on-transfer token is the reward token, the amount sent vs received would differ.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Decide which value is to be returned and logged. Either update the function to be `_sendErc20AndGetReceivedAmount()` or change it to use the contract’s balance difference instead.

```jsx
uint256 senderBalance = _token.balanceOf(address(this));
_token.safeTransfer(_to, _amount);
return _token.balanceOf(address(this)) - senderBalance;
```

## [L-06] Add constructor initializer in implementation contracts

### Description

As per [OpenZeppelin’s (OZ) recommendation](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/uupsupgradeable-vulnerability-post-mortem/15680/6), “The guidelines are now to make it impossible for *anyone* to run `initialize` on an implementation contract, by adding an empty constructor with the `initializer` modifier. So the implementation contract gets initialized automatically upon deployment.”

Note that this behaviour is also incorporated the [OZ Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/) since the UUPS vulnerability discovery: “Additionally, we modified the code generated by the [Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/) to include a constructor that automatically initializes the implementation when deployed.”

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add an empty constructor method to the relevant upgradeable contracts.

```jsx
/// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
constructor() initializer {}
```

## [L-07] Consider having limit on gas fee charged

### Line References

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/main/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityPool.sol#L330-L336>

### Description

There is no limit to the gas fee charged. While it is claimed that “there are no incentives for the executors”, in reality, executors can be indirectly incentivised by inflating the gas price so that they will be credited a higher fee.

The fee can be as high as the bridged amount - transfer fee, leaving nothing for the user. While there is a lot of trust placed on the executor already, it would help to be able to provide a trust-less solution by enforcing a cap on the gas fee.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Limit the maximum gas fee chargeable.

## [N-01] Typo errors

*   [`reightful` → `rightful`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/main/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityFarming.sol#L178)
*   [`Claculate` → `Calculate`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/main/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityProviders.sol#L357)
*   [`sushi` → `reward`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/main/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityFarming.sol#L167-L168)

## [N-02] Missing underscore for error

### Line Reference

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/main/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityFarming.sol#L103>

### Description

The format seems to be 2 underscores after `ERR`, but the line reference above only has 1 underscore: `ERR_REWARD_TOKEN_IS_ZERO`.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

`ERR_REWARD_TOKEN_IS_ZERO` -> `ERR__REWARD_TOKEN_IS_ZERO`

## [N-03] Swap comment order

### Line Reference

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/main/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityPool.sol#L351>

### Description

The variable order in the comment do not correspond to that of the implementation. For readability, I recommend that they do.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

```jsx
uint256 numerator = providedLiquidity * equilibriumFee * maxFee; // L(e) * F(e) * F(max)
```

## [N-04] Deep factor not customisable

### Reference

[https://biconomy.notion.site/Self-Balancing-Cross-Chain-Liquidity-Pools-c19a725673964d5aaec6b16e5c7ce9a5](https://www.notion.so/Self-Balancing-Cross-Chain-Liquidity-Pools-c19a725673964d5aaec6b16e5c7ce9a5)

### Description

The fee calculation formula mentions a deep factor `d`: *Value that decides how much deeper the curve looks.* Readers may have the impression that this may therefore be a customisable parameter in the contract, but in actual factor, is set to a constant value of `1`.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Users / readers should be made aware that the deep factor has been fixed.

## [N-05] Incorrect comment for description of `BASE_DIVISOR`

### Line References

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/main/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityPool.sol#L20>

### Description

`BASE_DIVISOR` is defined as `10_000_000_000;` with accompanying description `// Basis Points * 100 for better accuracy`.

This isn’t accurate as `100% = 10,000` basis points, and `10,000 * 100 = 1_000_000`, not `10_000_000_000`.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Either update the comment to be

`uint256 private constant BASE_DIVISOR = 10_000_000_000; // 100 * (Basis Points ^ 2) for better accuracy`

or the `BASE_DIVISOR` itself to be a different value.

## [N-06] Standardize fee denomination

### Line References

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/main/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityPool.sol#L20>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/main/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityPool.sol#L350>

### Description

In relation to L02, there are conflicting definitions of the fee denomination. `BASE_DIVISOR` says that fees are in `Basis points * 100`, while the comment in `getTransferFees()` says they are specified in `basis points * 10`.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Standardize the fee denomination.

## [N-07] Incorrect comment for address to use for withdrawing native token

### Line References

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/main/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityFarming.sol#L175>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/main/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityFarming.sol#L186>

### Description

The comment says to `use 0x00 for Ethereum`, but the implementation uses `NATIVE` instead.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

`use 0x00 for Ethereum` → `use NATIVE for native token`

## [N-08] Clarify reserve variable descriptions

### Line References

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-biconomy/blob/main/contracts/hyphen/LiquidityProviders.sol#L42-L44>

### Description

It is unclear what each variable consists of, because there is:

*   Supplied liquidity (SL) from liquidity providers
*   Available liquidity: SL + net deposits and withdrawals from bridging activity
*   Incentive fees
*   Gas fees
*   LP fees (accumulated equilibrium fees)

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

It would be best to explictly state what each variable consists of for clarity.

```jsx
mapping(address => uint256) public totalReserve; // Supplied Liquidity (SL) + LP Fees
mapping(address => uint256) public totalLiquidity; // Supplied Liquidity only
// Available liquidity = SL + net deposits and withdrawals from bridging activity
mapping(address => uint256) public currentLiquidity; // Available Liquidity + All Fees (LP, Incentive, Gas), updated on every in and out transfer
```

## Foreword

*   **Storage-reading optimizations**

> The code can be optimized by minimising the number of SLOADs. SLOADs are expensive (100 gas) compared to MLOADs/MSTOREs (3 gas). In the paragraphs below, please see the `@audit-issue` tags in the pieces of code's comments for more information about SLOADs that could be saved by caching the mentioned **storage** variables in **memory** variables.

*   **Unchecking arithmetics operations that can't underflow/overflow**

> Solidity version 0.8+ comes with implicit overflow and underflow checks on unsigned integers. When an overflow or an underflow isn't possible (as an example, when a comparison is made before the arithmetic operation, or the operation doesn't depend on user input), some gas can be saved by using an `unchecked` block: <https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.10/control-structures.html#checked-or-unchecked-arithmetic>

*   **`@audit` tags**

> The code is annotated at multiple places with `//@audit` comments to pinpoint the issues. Please, pay attention to them for more details.

## File: LPToken.sol

### function updateTokenMetadata()

```solidity
File: LPToken.sol
89:     function updateTokenMetadata(uint256 _tokenId, LpTokenMetadata memory _lpTokenMetadata) //@audit should be calldata
90:         external
91:         onlyHyphenPools
92:         whenNotPaused
93:     {
94:         require(_exists(_tokenId), "ERR__TOKEN_DOES_NOT_EXIST");
95:         tokenMetadata[_tokenId] = _lpTokenMetadata;
96:     }
```

#### Use `calldata` instead of `memory` for `LpTokenMetadata memory _lpTokenMetadata`

When arguments are read-only on external functions, the data location should be `calldata`.
Here, `LpTokenMetadata memory _lpTokenMetadata` should be `LpTokenMetadata calldata _lpTokenMetadata`

### function tokenURI()

```solidity
112:     function tokenURI(uint256 tokenId)
...
124:         string memory svgData = svgHelper.getTokenSvg(
125:             tokenId,
126:             tokenMetadata[tokenId].suppliedLiquidity, //@audit tokenMetadata[tokenId].suppliedLiquidity SLOAD 1
127:             ILiquidityProviders(liquidityProvidersAddress).totalReserve(tokenAddress) //@audit external call 1
128:         );
129: 
130:         string memory description = svgHelper.getDescription(
131:             tokenMetadata[tokenId].suppliedLiquidity,//@audit tokenMetadata[tokenId].suppliedLiquidity SLOAD 2
132:             ILiquidityProviders(liquidityProvidersAddress).totalReserve(tokenAddress) //@audit external call 2
133:         );
134: 
135:         string memory attributes = svgHelper.getAttributes(
136:             tokenMetadata[tokenId].suppliedLiquidity,//@audit tokenMetadata[tokenId].suppliedLiquidity SLOAD 3
137:             ILiquidityProviders(liquidityProvidersAddress).totalReserve(tokenAddress) //@audit external call 3
138:         );
```

#### Cache `tokenMetadata[tokenId].suppliedLiquidity`

Storage readings are expensive.
Caching this in a memory variable can save around 2 SLOADs

#### Cache `ILiquidityProviders(liquidityProvidersAddress).totalReserve(tokenAddress)`

External calls are expensive.
Caching this in a memory variable can save around 2 external calls.

### function \_beforeTokenTransfer()

```solidity
180:     function _beforeTokenTransfer(
181:         address from,
182:         address to,
183:         uint256 tokenId
184:     ) internal virtual override(ERC721EnumerableUpgradeable, ERC721Upgradeable) whenNotPaused {
185:         super._beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, tokenId);
186: 
187:         // Only call whitelist period manager for NFT Transfers, not mint and burns
188:         if (from != address(0) && to != address(0)) { //@audit-issue
189:             whiteListPeriodManager.beforeLiquidityTransfer(
190:                 from,
191:                 to,
192:                 tokenMetadata[tokenId].token,
193:                 tokenMetadata[tokenId].suppliedLiquidity
194:             );
195:         }
196:     }
```

#### Short-circuiting can save gas

The condition L188 can be short-circuited to provide a happy path with the following optimization:

```solidity
        if (from == address(0) || to == address(0)) {
          return;
        } 

        whiteListPeriodManager.beforeLiquidityTransfer(
            from,
            to,
            tokenMetadata[tokenId].token,
            tokenMetadata[tokenId].suppliedLiquidity
        );
```

This way, the gas from evaluating the second condition can be saved in case of minting (in this scenario, we're expecting more minting than burning, therefore making a happy path for it).

## File: TokenManager.sol

### Tight Packing `struct TokenInfo`

To save 1 slot, the struct should go from:

```solidity
File: ITokenManager.sol
06:     struct TokenInfo {
07:         uint256 transferOverhead; //@audit 32 bytes
08:         bool supportedToken; //@audit 1 byte
09:         uint256 equilibriumFee; //@audit 32 bytes
10:         uint256 maxFee; //@audit 32 bytes
11:         TokenConfig tokenConfig;//@audit 20 bytes
12:     }
```

to

```solidity
06:     struct TokenInfo {
07:         uint256 transferOverhead; //@audit 32 bytes
08:         uint256 equilibriumFee; //@audit 32 bytes
09:         uint256 maxFee; //@audit 32 bytes
10:         TokenConfig tokenConfig;//@audit 20 bytes
11:         bool supportedToken; //@audit 1 byte
12:     }
```

### function changeFee()

```solidity
File: TokenManager.sol
44:     function changeFee(
45:         address tokenAddress,
46:         uint256 _equilibriumFee,
47:         uint256 _maxFee
48:     ) external override onlyOwner whenNotPaused {
49:         require(_equilibriumFee != 0, "Equilibrium Fee cannot be 0");
50:         require(_maxFee != 0, "Max Fee cannot be 0");
51:         tokensInfo[tokenAddress].equilibriumFee = _equilibriumFee;
52:         tokensInfo[tokenAddress].maxFee = _maxFee;
53:         emit FeeChanged(tokenAddress, tokensInfo[tokenAddress].equilibriumFee, tokensInfo[tokenAddress].maxFee);
54:     }
```

#### Storage optimization

Instead of fetching the storage value multiple times from the array, it's possible to save some gas and help the optimizer by using a storage variable:

```solidity
        TokenInfo storage _tokenInfo = tokensInfo[tokenAddress];
        _tokenInfo.equilibriumFee = _equilibriumFee;
        _tokenInfo.maxFee = _maxFee;
```

#### Emitting storage value

Storage values are being emitted L53.
I suggest using:

```solidity
emit FeeChanged(tokenAddress, _equilibriumFee, _maxFee);
```

### function setDepositConfig()

```solidity
File: TokenManager.sol
69:     function setDepositConfig(
70:         uint256[] memory toChainId,//@audit should be calldata
71:         address[] memory tokenAddresses,//@audit should be calldata
72:         TokenConfig[] memory tokenConfig//@audit should be calldata
73:     ) external onlyOwner {
74:         require(
75:             (toChainId.length == tokenAddresses.length) && (tokenAddresses.length == tokenConfig.length),
76:             " ERR_ARRAY_LENGTH_MISMATCH"
77:         );
78:         for (uint256 index = 0; index < tokenConfig.length; ++index) { //@audit use storage var
79:             depositConfig[toChainId[index]][tokenAddresses[index]].min = tokenConfig[index].min;
80:             depositConfig[toChainId[index]][tokenAddresses[index]].max = tokenConfig[index].max;
81:         }
82:     }
```

#### Use `calldata` instead of `memory` for `uint256[] memory toChainId`

#### Use `calldata` instead of `memory` for `address[] memory tokenAddresses`

#### Use `calldata` instead of `memory` for `TokenConfig[] memory tokenConfig`

#### Storage usage optimization

I suggest going from:

```solidity
    depositConfig[toChainId[index]][tokenAddresses[index]].min = tokenConfig[index].min;
    depositConfig[toChainId[index]][tokenAddresses[index]].max = tokenConfig[index].max;
```

to:

```solidity
      TokenConfig storage _sTokenConfig = depositConfig[toChainId[index]][tokenAddresses[index]];
      _sTokenConfig.min = tokenConfig[index].min;
      _sTokenConfig.max = tokenConfig[index].max;
```

### function getTokensInfo()

```solidity
115:     function getTokensInfo(address tokenAddress) public view override returns (TokenInfo memory) {
116:         TokenInfo memory tokenInfo = TokenInfo( //@audit can simply return this instead of saving in a memory var (MSTORE + MLOAD to save)
117:             tokensInfo[tokenAddress].transferOverhead,
118:             tokensInfo[tokenAddress].supportedToken,
119:             tokensInfo[tokenAddress].equilibriumFee,
120:             tokensInfo[tokenAddress].maxFee,
121:             transferConfig[tokenAddress]
122:         );
123:         return tokenInfo;
124:     }
```

#### The variable `tokenInfo` is only used once: inline it

I suggest the following optimization:

```solidity
function getTokensInfo(address tokenAddress) public view override returns (TokenInfo memory) {
        return TokenInfo(
            tokensInfo[tokenAddress].transferOverhead,
            tokensInfo[tokenAddress].supportedToken,
            tokensInfo[tokenAddress].equilibriumFee,
            tokensInfo[tokenAddress].maxFee,
            transferConfig[tokenAddress]
        );
    }
```

I believe we can go further here, as the copy in memory is done manually here. As `TokenConfig` is already contained inside the `TokenInfo` struct, this should be the best option:

```solidity
function getTokensInfo(address tokenAddress) public view override returns (TokenInfo memory) {
        return tokensInfo[tokenAddress];
    }
```

## File: LiquidityFarming.sol

### Tight Packing `struct NFTInfo`

To save 1 slot, I suggest going from:

```solidity
File: LiquidityFarming.sol
29:     struct NFTInfo {
30:         address payable staker; //@audit-info 20 bytes
31:         uint256 rewardDebt; //@audit-info 32 bytes
32:         uint256 unpaidRewards; //@audit-info 32 bytes
33:         bool isStaked; //@audit-info 1 byte
34:     }
```

to

```solidity
File: LiquidityFarming.sol
29:     struct NFTInfo {
30:         uint256 rewardDebt; //@audit-info 32 bytes
31:         uint256 unpaidRewards; //@audit-info 32 bytes
32:         address payable staker; //@audit-info 20 bytes
33:         bool isStaked; //@audit-info 1 byte
34:     }
```

### function \_sendErc20AndGetSentAmount()

```solidity
File: LiquidityFarming.sol
109:     function _sendErc20AndGetSentAmount(
110:         IERC20Upgradeable _token,
111:         uint256 _amount,
112:         address _to
113:     ) private returns (uint256) {
114:         uint256 recepientBalance = _token.balanceOf(_to);
115:         _token.safeTransfer(_to, _amount);
116:         return _token.balanceOf(_to) - recepientBalance; //@audit should be unchecked (see L114-L115)
117:     }
```

#### Uncheck L116

This line can't underflow due to L114-L115. Therefore, it should be wrapped in an `unchecked` block.

### function deposit()

#### Consider adding a function in `ILPToken` to save 1 external call

Here, if a function is added in `ILPToken` to check both conditions in 1 call, it could save 1 external call:

```solidity
File: LiquidityFarming.sol
199:         require(
200:             lpToken.isApprovedForAll(msgSender, address(this)) || lpToken.getApproved(_nftId) == address(this), //@audit save 1 external call with a new method
201:             "ERR__NOT_APPROVED"
202:         );
```

### function withdraw()

#### Uncheck L240

As `nftIdsStaked[msgSender][index] = nftIdsStaked[msgSender][nftIdsStaked[msgSender].length - 1];` can never underflow due to the require statement above it and the for-loop, it should be wrapped in an `unchecked` block.

#### Use the existing variable `nftsStakedLength` instead of `nftIdsStaked[msgSender].length`

As no push or pop operations are done yet, I suggest going from:

```solidity
File: LiquidityFarming.sol
231:         uint256 nftsStakedLength = nftIdsStaked[msgSender].length;
...
240:         nftIdsStaked[msgSender][index] = nftIdsStaked[msgSender][nftIdsStaked[msgSender].length - 1];
```

to

```solidity
File: LiquidityFarming.sol
231:         uint256 nftsStakedLength = nftIdsStaked[msgSender].length;
...
240:         nftIdsStaked[msgSender][index] = nftIdsStaked[msgSender][nftsStakedLength - 1];
```

### function getUpdatedAccTokenPerShare()

```solidity
File: LiquidityFarming.sol
265:     function getUpdatedAccTokenPerShare(address _baseToken) public view returns (uint256) {
...
274:             unchecked {
275:                 accumulator +=
276:                     rewardRateLog[_baseToken][i].rewardsPerSecond * // @audit rewardRateLog[_baseToken][i] in storage
277:                     (counter - max(lastUpdatedTime, rewardRateLog[_baseToken][i].timestamp)); //@audit rewardRateLog[_baseToken][i].timestamp SLOAD 1
278:             }
279:             counter = rewardRateLog[_baseToken][i].timestamp; //@audit rewardRateLog[_baseToken][i].timestamp SLOAD 2
280:             if (i == 0) {
281:                 break;
282:             }
283:             --i;//@audit should be unchecked (see L280-L281)
284:         }
...
```

#### Storage usage optimization

#### Cache `rewardRateLog[_baseToken][i].timestamp` in memory

#### Uncheck L283

Here, it's possible to save a substantial amount of gas with the following optimization (taking into account the 3 titles above):

```solidity
        while (true) {
            if (lastUpdatedTime >= counter) {
                break;
            }
            RewardsPerSecondEntry storage _reward = rewardRateLog[_baseToken][i]; //@audit added code
            uint256 _timestamp = _reward.timestamp; //@audit added code
            unchecked {
                accumulator +=
                    _reward.rewardsPerSecond * // @audit storage optimization
                    (counter - max(lastUpdatedTime, _timestamp)); //@audit MLOAD
            
                counter = _timestamp; //@audit MLOAD
                if (i == 0) {
                    break;
                }
                --i;//@audit now unchecked
            }
        }
```

### function max()

#### A private function used only once should get inlined

As `function max()` is a private function (not inherited) that is only used once in the contract (L277), it should get inlined.

## File: LiquidityPool.sol

### modifier onlyLiquidityProviders()

#### `modifier onlyLiquidityProviders()` is used only once and should get inlined

As `modifier onlyLiquidityProviders()` is only used once (on `function transfer()`), it should get inlined.

### function depositErc20()

#### Avoid multiple external calls on `tokenManager.getDepositConfig(toChainId, tokenAddress)`

The code can be optimized from:

```solidity
File: LiquidityPool.sol
156:         require(
157:             tokenManager.getDepositConfig(toChainId, tokenAddress).min <= amount && //@audit external call 1
158:                 tokenManager.getDepositConfig(toChainId, tokenAddress).max >= amount, //@audit external call 2
159:             "Deposit amount not in Cap limit"
160:         );
```

to

```solidity
156:         ITokenManager.TokenConfig memory _depositConfig = tokenManager.getDepositConfig(toChainId, tokenAddress); //@audit external call 1
157:         require(
158:             _depositConfig.min <= amount && //@audit MLOAD
159:                 _depositConfig.max >= amount, //@audit MLOAD
160:             "Deposit amount not in Cap limit"
161:         );
```

### function getRewardAmount()

```solidity
File: LiquidityPool.sol
175:     function getRewardAmount(uint256 amount, address tokenAddress) public view returns (uint256 rewardAmount) {
176:         uint256 currentLiquidity = getCurrentLiquidity(tokenAddress);
177:         uint256 providedLiquidity = liquidityProviders.getSuppliedLiquidityByToken(tokenAddress);
178:         if (currentLiquidity < providedLiquidity) {
179:             uint256 liquidityDifference = providedLiquidity - currentLiquidity; //@audit should be unchecked (see L178)
```

#### Uncheck L179

As `providedLiquidity - currentLiquidity` can never underflow due to the if statement above it, it should be wrapped in an `unchecked` block.

### function depositNative()

#### Avoid multiple external calls on `tokenManager.getDepositConfig(toChainId, NATIVE)`

The code can be optimized from:

```solidity
File: LiquidityPool.sol
247:         require(
248:             tokenManager.getDepositConfig(toChainId, NATIVE).min <= msg.value && //@audit external call 1
249:                 tokenManager.getDepositConfig(toChainId, NATIVE).max >= msg.value, //@audit external call 2
250:             "Deposit amount not in Cap limit"
251:         );

```

to

```solidity
File: LiquidityPool.sol
247:         ITokenManager.TokenConfig memory _depositConfig = tokenManager.getDepositConfig(toChainId, NATIVE); //@audit external call 1
248:         require(
249:             _depositConfig.min <= msg.value && //@audit MLOAD
250:                 _depositConfig.max >= msg.value, //@audit MLOAD
251:             "Deposit amount not in Cap limit"
252:         );
```

### function sendFundsToUser()

#### Avoid multiple external calls on `tokenManager.getTransferConfig(tokenAddress)`

The code can be optimized from:

```solidity
File: LiquidityPool.sol
272:         require(
273:             tokenManager.getTransferConfig(tokenAddress).min <= amount && //@audit external call 1
274:                 tokenManager.getTransferConfig(tokenAddress).max >= amount, //@audit external call 2
275:             "Withdraw amnt not in Cap limits"
276:         );
```

to

```solidity
File: LiquidityPool.sol
272:         ITokenManager.TokenConfig memory _transferConfig = tokenManager.getTransferConfig(tokenAddress); //@audit external call 1
273:         require(
274:             _transferConfig.min <= amount && //@audit MLOAD
275:                 _transferConfig.max >= amount, //@audit MLOAD
276:             "Withdraw amnt not in Cap limits"
277:         );
```

#### Reorder require statements to save gas on revert

Here, there are two require statements:

```solidity
File: LiquidityPool.sol
272:         require(
273:             tokenManager.getTransferConfig(tokenAddress).min <= amount &&
274:                 tokenManager.getTransferConfig(tokenAddress).max >= amount,
275:             "Withdraw amnt not in Cap limits"
276:         );
277:         require(receiver != address(0), "Bad receiver address"); //@audit should be 1st require
```

The second require statement is a simple condition that is a lot less expensive than the first one. In case of revert on the second require statement, all the gas from the first require would be wasted (2 external calls, or 1 after the optimization).
I suggest reordering the require statements to put this one first.

### function getAmountToTransfer()

```solidity
File: LiquidityPool.sol
308:     function getAmountToTransfer(
...
316:         if (transferFeePerc > tokenManager.getTokensInfo(tokenAddress).equilibriumFee) { //@audit external call 1
317:             // Here add some fee to incentive pool also
318:             lpFee = (amount * tokenManager.getTokensInfo(tokenAddress).equilibriumFee) / BASE_DIVISOR; //@audit external call 2
319:             incentivePool[tokenAddress] =
320:                 (incentivePool[tokenAddress] +
321:                     (amount * (transferFeePerc - tokenManager.getTokensInfo(tokenAddress).equilibriumFee))) / //@audit substraction should be unchecked //@audit external call 3
322:                 BASE_DIVISOR;
```

#### Avoid multiple external calls on `tokenManager.getTokensInfo(tokenAddress).equilibriumFee`

`tokenManager.getTokensInfo(tokenAddress).equilibriumFee` should get cached to avoid 2 unnecessary external calls.

#### Uncheck L321

As `transferFeePerc - tokenManager.getTokensInfo(tokenAddress).equilibriumFee` can never underflow due to the if statement above it L316, it should be wrapped in an `unchecked` block.

### function getTransferFee()

```solidity
File: LiquidityPool.sol
342:     function getTransferFee(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount) public view returns (uint256 fee) {
...
348:         uint256 equilibriumFee = tokenManager.getTokensInfo(tokenAddress).equilibriumFee; //@audit external call 1
349:         uint256 maxFee = tokenManager.getTokensInfo(tokenAddress).maxFee;//@audit external call 2
...
```

#### Avoid multiple external calls on `tokenManager.getTokensInfo(tokenAddress)`

I suggest the following optimization:

```solidity
File: LiquidityPool.sol
348:         ITokenManager.TokenInfo memory _tokenInfo = tokenManager.getTokensInfo(tokenAddress); //@audit external call 1
349:         uint256 equilibriumFee = _tokenInfo.equilibriumFee; //@audit MLOAD
350:         uint256 maxFee = _tokenInfo.maxFee; //@audit MLOAD
```

## File: LiquidityProviders.sol

### Storage

```solidity
27:     uint256 public constant BASE_DIVISOR = 10**18; //@audit gas use 1e18
```

#### Use `1e18` instead of `10**18` for constant `BASE_DIVISOR`

Due to how `constant` variables are implemented (constant expressions are expressions, not constants), `10**18` will be more expensive than `1e18`.

### modifier onlyValidLpToken()

#### Consider adding a function in `ILPToken` to save 1 external call

Here, the modifier is quite expensive as it makes 2 external calls:

```solidity
File: LiquidityProviders.sol
53:     modifier onlyValidLpToken(uint256 _tokenId, address _transactor) { //@audit expensive modifier. Create 1 method that returns both parametters
54:         (address token, , ) = lpToken.tokenMetadata(_tokenId);
55:         require(lpToken.exists(_tokenId), "ERR__TOKEN_DOES_NOT_EXIST"); //@audit external call 1
56:         require(lpToken.ownerOf(_tokenId) == _transactor, "ERR__TRANSACTOR_DOES_NOT_OWN_NFT"); //@audit external call 2
57:         _;
58:     }
```

Consider adding a method in `ILPToken` that both checks that `_tokenId` exists and returns the token's owner.

### function \_increaseCurrentLiquidity()

```solidity
File: LiquidityProviders.sol
135:     function _increaseCurrentLiquidity(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount) private {
136:         currentLiquidity[tokenAddress] += amount; //@audit SLOAD 1
137:         emit CurrentLiquidityChanged(tokenAddress, currentLiquidity[tokenAddress]-amount, currentLiquidity[tokenAddress]); //@audit SLOAD 2 & 3
138:     }
```

#### Cache `currentLiquidity[tokenAddress]`

Caching this in a memory variable can save around 2 SLOADs. Here's the full optimization:

```solidity
File: LiquidityProviders.sol
135:     function _increaseCurrentLiquidity(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount) private {
136:         uint256 _currentLiquidity = currentLiquidity[tokenAddress];
137:         uint256 _increasedLiquidity = _currentLiquidity + amount;
138:         currentLiquidity[tokenAddress] = _increasedLiquidity;
139:         emit CurrentLiquidityChanged(tokenAddress, _currentLiquidity, _increasedLiquidity);
140:     }
```

### function \_decreaseCurrentLiquidity()

```solidity
File: LiquidityProviders.sol
140:     function _decreaseCurrentLiquidity(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount) private {
141:         currentLiquidity[tokenAddress] -= amount; //@audit SLOAD 1
142:         emit CurrentLiquidityChanged(tokenAddress, currentLiquidity[tokenAddress]+amount, currentLiquidity[tokenAddress]); //@audit SLOAD 2 & 3
143:     }
```

#### Cache `currentLiquidity[tokenAddress]`

Caching this in a memory variable can save around 2 SLOADs. Here's the full optimization:

```solidity
File: LiquidityProviders.sol
140:     function _decreaseCurrentLiquidity(address tokenAddress, uint256 amount) private {
141:         uint256 _currentLiquidity = currentLiquidity[tokenAddress];
142:         uint256 _decreasedLiquidity = _currentLiquidity - amount;
143:         currentLiquidity[tokenAddress] = _decreasedLiquidity;
144:         emit CurrentLiquidityChanged(tokenAddress, _currentLiquidity, _decreasedLiquidity);
145:     }
```

### function getTokenPriceInLPShares()

```solidity
File: LiquidityProviders.sol
180:     function getTokenPriceInLPShares(address _baseToken) public view returns (uint256) {
181:         uint256 supply = totalSharesMinted[_baseToken];
182:         if (supply > 0) {
183:             return totalSharesMinted[_baseToken] / totalReserve[_baseToken]; //@audit SLOAD : use supply.
184:         }
185:         return BASE_DIVISOR;
186:     }
```

#### Use `supply` instead of `totalSharesMinted[_baseToken]`

At line 183, I suggest using `supply` instead of `totalSharesMinted[_baseToken]`. Full code:

```solidity
File: LiquidityProviders.sol
180:     function getTokenPriceInLPShares(address _baseToken) public view returns (uint256) {
181:         uint256 supply = totalSharesMinted[_baseToken];
182:         if (supply > 0) {
183:             return supply / totalReserve[_baseToken];
184:         }
185:         return BASE_DIVISOR;
186:     }
```

### function \_increaseLiquidity()

```solidity
File: LiquidityProviders.sol
280:     function _increaseLiquidity(uint256 _nftId, uint256 _amount) internal onlyValidLpToken(_nftId, _msgSender()) {
281:         (address token, uint256 totalSuppliedLiquidity, uint256 totalShares) = lpToken.tokenMetadata(_nftId);
282: 
283:         require(_amount > 0, "ERR__AMOUNT_IS_0");
284:         whiteListPeriodManager.beforeLiquidityAddition(_msgSender(), token, _amount);
285: 
286:         uint256 mintedSharesAmount;
287:         // Adding liquidity in the pool for the first time
288:         if (totalReserve[token] == 0) { //@audit totalReserve[token] SLOAD 1
289:             mintedSharesAmount = BASE_DIVISOR * _amount;
290:         } else {
291:             mintedSharesAmount = (_amount * totalSharesMinted[token]) / totalReserve[token]; //@audit totalReserve[token] SLOAD 2 //@audit totalSharesMinted[token] SLOAD 1
292:         }
293: 
294:         require(mintedSharesAmount >= BASE_DIVISOR, "ERR__AMOUNT_BELOW_MIN_LIQUIDITY");
295: 
296:         totalLiquidity[token] += _amount;
297:         totalReserve[token] += _amount; //@audit totalReserve[token] SLOAD 3
298:         totalSharesMinted[token] += mintedSharesAmount; //@audit totalSharesMinted[token] SLOAD 2 (after 1st liquidity)
```

#### Cache `totalReserve[token]`

Caching this in memory can save around 2 SLOADs

#### Cache `totalSharesMinted[token]`

Caching this in memory can save around 1 SLOAD (only after 1st liquidity adding in the pool for the first time)

### function ifEnabled()

```solidity
File: WhitelistPeriodManager.sol
260:     function ifEnabled(bool _cond) private view returns (bool) {
261:         return !areWhiteListRestrictionsEnabled || (areWhiteListRestrictionsEnabled && _cond); // @audit can save 1 SLOAD with (!areWhiteListRestrictionsEnabled || _cond) as the 2nd condition will evaluate only if areWhiteListRestrictionsEnabled == true
262:     }
```

#### The condition can be optimized to save a SLOAD

`!areWhiteListRestrictionsEnabled || (areWhiteListRestrictionsEnabled && _cond)` should be changed to `!areWhiteListRestrictionsEnabled || _cond` as the 2nd part of this statement will only evaluate if `areWhiteListRestrictionsEnabled == true`, therefore the explicit check isn't necessary.

## General recommendations

### Version

#### Upgrade pragma to at least 0.8.4

Using newer compiler versions and the optimizer give gas optimizations. Also, additional safety checks are available for free.

The advantages here are:

*   **Low level inliner** (>= 0.8.2): Cheaper runtime gas (especially relevant when the contract has small functions).
*   **Optimizer improvements in packed structs** (>= 0.8.3)
*   **Custom errors** (>= 0.8.4): cheaper deployment cost and runtime cost. *Note*: the runtime cost is only relevant when the revert condition is met. In short, replace revert strings by custom errors.

Instances include:

```solidity
hyphen/token/LPToken.sol:2:pragma solidity 0.8.0;
hyphen/token/TokenManager.sol:3:pragma solidity 0.8.0;
hyphen/ExecutorManager.sol:3:pragma solidity 0.8.0;
hyphen/LiquidityFarming.sol:2:pragma solidity 0.8.0;
hyphen/LiquidityPool.sol:3:pragma solidity 0.8.0;
hyphen/LiquidityProviders.sol:2:pragma solidity 0.8.0;
hyphen/WhitelistPeriodManager.sol:2:pragma solidity 0.8.0;
```

Consider upgrading pragma to at least 0.8.4.

### Variables

#### No need to explicitly initialize variables with default values

If a variable is not set/initialized, it is assumed to have the default value (`0` for `uint`, `false` for `bool`, `address(0)` for address...). Explicitly initializing it with its default value is an anti-pattern and wastes gas.

As an example: `for (uint256 i = 0; i < numIterations; ++i) {` should be replaced with `for (uint256 i; i < numIterations; ++i) {`

Instances include:

```solidity
hyphen/token/LPToken.sol:77:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < nftIds.length; ++i) {
hyphen/token/TokenManager.sol:78:        for (uint256 index = 0; index < tokenConfig.length; ++index) {
hyphen/ExecutorManager.sol:31:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < executorArray.length; ++i) {
hyphen/ExecutorManager.sol:47:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < executorArray.length; ++i) {
hyphen/LiquidityFarming.sol:233:        for (index = 0; index < nftsStakedLength; ++index) {
hyphen/LiquidityFarming.sol:266:        uint256 accumulator = 0;
hyphen/WhitelistPeriodManager.sol:180:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _addresses.length; ++i) {
hyphen/WhitelistPeriodManager.sol:228:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _tokens.length; ++i) {
hyphen/WhitelistPeriodManager.sol:247:        uint256 maxLp = 0;
```

I suggest removing explicit initializations for default values.

#### Pre-increments cost less gas compared to post-increments

### Comparisons

#### `> 0` is less efficient than `!= 0` for unsigned integers (with proof)

`!= 0` costs less gas compared to `> 0` for unsigned integers in `require` statements with the optimizer enabled (6 gas)

Proof: While it may seem that `> 0` is cheaper than `!=`, this is only true without the optimizer enabled and outside a require statement. If you enable the optimizer at 10k AND you're in a `require` statement, this will save gas. You can see this tweet for more proofs: <https://twitter.com/gzeon/status/1485428085885640706>

I suggest changing `> 0` with `!= 0` here:

```solidity
hyphen/LiquidityProviders.sol:239:        require(_amount > 0, "ERR__AMOUNT_IS_0");
hyphen/LiquidityProviders.sol:283:        require(_amount > 0, "ERR__AMOUNT_IS_0");
hyphen/LiquidityProviders.sol:410:        require(lpFeeAccumulated > 0, "ERR__NO_REWARDS_TO_CLAIM");
```

Also, please enable the Optimizer.

### For-Loops

#### An array's length should be cached to save gas in for-loops

Reading array length at each iteration of the loop takes 6 gas (3 for mload and 3 to place memory_offset) in the stack.

Caching the array length in the stack saves around 3 gas per iteration.

Here, I suggest storing the array's length in a variable before the for-loop, and use it instead:

```solidity
hyphen/token/LPToken.sol:77:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < nftIds.length; ++i) {
hyphen/token/TokenManager.sol:78:        for (uint256 index = 0; index < tokenConfig.length; ++index) {
hyphen/ExecutorManager.sol:31:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < executorArray.length; ++i) {
hyphen/ExecutorManager.sol:47:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < executorArray.length; ++i) {
hyphen/WhitelistPeriodManager.sol:180:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _addresses.length; ++i) {
hyphen/WhitelistPeriodManager.sol:228:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _tokens.length; ++i) {
```

#### Increments can be unchecked

In Solidity 0.8+, there's a default overflow check on unsigned integers. It's possible to uncheck this in for-loops and save some gas at each iteration, but at the cost of some code readability, as this uncheck cannot be made inline.

[ethereum/solidity#10695](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10695)

Instances include:

```solidity
hyphen/token/LPToken.sol:77:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < nftIds.length; ++i) {
hyphen/token/TokenManager.sol:78:        for (uint256 index = 0; index < tokenConfig.length; ++index) {
hyphen/ExecutorManager.sol:31:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < executorArray.length; ++i) {
hyphen/ExecutorManager.sol:47:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < executorArray.length; ++i) {
hyphen/LiquidityFarming.sol:233:        for (index = 0; index < nftsStakedLength; ++index) {
hyphen/WhitelistPeriodManager.sol:180:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _addresses.length; ++i) {
hyphen/WhitelistPeriodManager.sol:228:        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _tokens.length; ++i) {
hyphen/WhitelistPeriodManager.sol:248:        for (uint256 i = 1; i <= totalSupply; ++i) {
```

The code would go from:

```solidity
for (uint256 i; i < numIterations; ++i) {  
 // ...  
}  
```

to:

```solidity
for (uint256 i; i < numIterations;) {  
 // ...  
 unchecked { ++i; }  
}  
```

The risk of overflow is inexistant for a `uint256` here.

### Visibility

 - TokenManager.getTransferConfig(address) (contracts/hyphen/token/TokenManager.sol#135-137)
```

### Errors

#### Reduce the size of error messages (Long revert Strings)

Shortening revert strings to fit in 32 bytes will decrease deployment time gas and will decrease runtime gas when the revert condition is met.

Revert strings that are longer than 32 bytes require at least one additional mstore, along with additional overhead for computing memory offset, etc.

Revert strings > 32 bytes:

```solidity
hyphen/token/LPToken.sol:70:        require(_whiteListPeriodManager != address(0), "ERR_INVALID_WHITELIST_PERIOD_MANAGER");
hyphen/ExecutorManager.sol:17:        require(executorStatus[msg.sender], "You are not allowed to perform this operation");
hyphen/LiquidityPool.sol:77:        require(_msgSender() == address(liquidityProviders), "Only liquidityProviders is allowed"); 
```

I suggest shortening the revert strings to fit in 32 bytes, or that using custom errors as described next.

#### Use Custom Errors instead of Revert Strings to save Gas

Custom errors from Solidity 0.8.4 are cheaper than revert strings (cheaper deployment cost and runtime cost when the revert condition is met)

Source: <https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/>:

> Starting from [Solidity v0.8.4](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.4), there is a convenient and gas-efficient way to explain to users why an operation failed through the use of custom errors. Until now, you could already use strings to give more information about failures (e.g., `revert("Insufficient funds.");`), but they are rather expensive, especially when it comes to deploy cost, and it is difficult to use dynamic information in them.

Custom errors are defined using the `error` statement, which can be used inside and outside of contracts (including interfaces and libraries).
