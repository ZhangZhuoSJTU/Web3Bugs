# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Paladin smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between March 29—April 2 2022.

# High Risk Findings (2)
## [[H-01] `DropPerSecond` is not updated homogeneously, the rewards emission can be much higher than expected in some cases](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-paladin-findings/issues/44)
_Submitted by WatchPug, also found by Czar102_

[HolyPaladinToken.sol#L715-L743](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-paladin/blob/9c26ec8556298fb1dc3cf71f471aadad3a5c74a0/contracts/HolyPaladinToken.sol#L715-L743)<br>

```solidity
function _updateDropPerSecond() internal returns (uint256){
    // If no more need for monthly updates => decrease duration is over
    if(block.timestamp > startDropTimestamp + dropDecreaseDuration) {
        // Set the current DropPerSecond as the end value
        // Plus allows to be updated if the end value is later updated
        if(currentDropPerSecond != endDropPerSecond) {
            currentDropPerSecond = endDropPerSecond;
            lastDropUpdate = block.timestamp;
        }

        return endDropPerSecond;
    }

    if(block.timestamp < lastDropUpdate + MONTH) return currentDropPerSecond; // Update it once a month

    uint256 dropDecreasePerMonth = (startDropPerSecond - endDropPerSecond) / (dropDecreaseDuration / MONTH);
    uint256 nbMonthEllapsed = (block.timestamp - lastDropUpdate) / MONTH;

    uint256 dropPerSecondDecrease = dropDecreasePerMonth * nbMonthEllapsed;

    // We calculate the new dropPerSecond value
    // We don't want to go under the endDropPerSecond
    uint256 newDropPerSecond = currentDropPerSecond - dropPerSecondDecrease > endDropPerSecond ? currentDropPerSecond - dropPerSecondDecrease : endDropPerSecond;

    currentDropPerSecond = newDropPerSecond;
    lastDropUpdate = block.timestamp;

    return newDropPerSecond;
}
```

When current time is `lastDropUpdate + (2*MONTH-1)`:

`nbMonthEllapsed` will be round down to `1`, while it's actually 1.99 months passed, but because of precision loss, the smart contract will believe it's only 1 month elapsed, as a result, `DropPerSecond` will only decrease by 1 \* `dropDecreasePerMonth`.

In another word, due to the precision loss in calculating the number of months elapsed, for each `_updateDropPerSecond()` there can be a short of up to `1 * dropDecreasePerMonth` for the decrease of emission rate.

At the very edge case, if all the updates happened just like the scenario above. by the end of the `dropDecreaseDuration`, it will drop only `12 * dropDecreasePerMonth` in total, while it's expected to be `24 * dropDecreasePerMonth`.

So only half of `(startDropPerSecond - endDropPerSecond)` is actually decreased. And the last time `updateDropPerSecond` is called, `DropPerSecond` will suddenly drop to `endDropPerSecond`.

### Impact

As the `DropPerSecond` is not updated correctly, in most of the `dropDecreaseDuration`, the actual rewards emission rate is much higher than expected. As a result, the total rewards emission can be much higher than expected.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change to:

```solidity
function _updateDropPerSecond() internal returns (uint256){
    // If no more need for monthly updates => decrease duration is over
    if(block.timestamp > startDropTimestamp + dropDecreaseDuration) {
        // Set the current DropPerSecond as the end value
        // Plus allows to be updated if the end value is later updated
        if(currentDropPerSecond != endDropPerSecond) {
            currentDropPerSecond = endDropPerSecond;
            lastDropUpdate = block.timestamp;
        }

        return endDropPerSecond;
    }

    if(block.timestamp < lastDropUpdate + MONTH) return currentDropPerSecond; // Update it once a month

    uint256 dropDecreasePerMonth = (startDropPerSecond - endDropPerSecond) / (dropDecreaseDuration / MONTH);
    uint256 nbMonthEllapsed = UNIT * (block.timestamp - lastDropUpdate) / MONTH;

    uint256 dropPerSecondDecrease = dropDecreasePerMonth * nbMonthEllapsed / UNIT;

    // We calculate the new dropPerSecond value
    // We don't want to go under the endDropPerSecond
    uint256 newDropPerSecond = currentDropPerSecond - dropPerSecondDecrease > endDropPerSecond ? currentDropPerSecond - dropPerSecondDecrease : endDropPerSecond;

    currentDropPerSecond = newDropPerSecond;
    lastDropUpdate = block.timestamp;

    return newDropPerSecond;
}
```

## [[H-02] System could be wrapped and made useless without contract whitelisting](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-paladin-findings/issues/77)
_Submitted by Picodes_

[HolyPaladinToken.sol#L253](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-paladin/blob/9c26ec8556298fb1dc3cf71f471aadad3a5c74a0/contracts/HolyPaladinToken.sol#L253)<br>
[HolyPaladinToken.sol#L284](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-paladin/blob/9c26ec8556298fb1dc3cf71f471aadad3a5c74a0/contracts/HolyPaladinToken.sol#L284)<br>
[HolyPaladinToken.sol#L268](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-paladin/blob/9c26ec8556298fb1dc3cf71f471aadad3a5c74a0/contracts/HolyPaladinToken.sol#L268)<br>

Anyone could create a contract or a contract factory "PAL Locker" with a fonction to deposit PAL tokens through a contract, lock them and delegate the voting power to the contract owner. Then, the ownership of this contract could be sold. By doing so, locked hPAL would be made liquid and transferrable again. This would eventually break the overall system of hPAL, where the idea is that you have to lock them to make them non liquid to get a boosted voting power and reward rate.

Paladin should expect this behavior to happen as we've seen it happening with veToken models and model implying locking features (see <https://lockers.stakedao.org/> and <https://www.convexfinance.com/>).

This behavior could eventually be beneficial to the original DAO (ex. <https://www.convexfinance.com/> for Curve and Frax), but the original DAO needs to at least be able to blacklist / whitelist such contracts and actors to ensure their interests are aligned with the protocol.

### Proof of Concept

To make locked hPAL liquid, Alice could create a contact C. Then, she can deposit hPAL through the contract, lock them and delegate voting power to herself. She can then sell or tokenize the ownership of the contract C.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Depending on if Paladin wants to be optimistic or pessimistic, implement a whitelisting / blacklisting system for contracts.

# Medium Risk Findings (15)
## [[M-01] `HolyPaladinToken.sol` uses `ERC20` token with a highly unsafe pattern](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-paladin-findings/issues/3)
_Submitted by jayjonah8_

In `HolyPaladinToken.sol` it imports `ERC20.sol` with some changes from the original Open Zeppelin standard.  One change is that the `transferFrom()` function does not follow the Checks Effect and Interactions safety pattern to safely make external calls to other contracts. All checks should be handled first, then any effects/state updates,  followed by the external call to prevent reentrancy attacks.  Currently the `transferFrom()` function in `ERC20.sol` used by `HolyPaladinToken.sol` calls `_transfer()` first and then updates the `sender` allowance which is highly unsafe.  The openZeppelin `ER20.sol` contract which is the industry standard first updates the `sender` allowance before calling `_transfer`.  The external call should always be done last to avoid any double spending bugs or reentrancy attacks.

### Proof of Concept

<https://fravoll.github.io/solidity-patterns/checks_effects_interactions.html>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-paladin/blob/main/contracts/open-zeppelin/ERC20.sol#L149>

Open Zeppelins Implementation:<br>
<https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Be sure to follow the Checks Effects and Interactions safety pattern as the `transferFrom` function is one of the most important functions in any protocol.  Consider importing the Open Zeppelin `ERC20.sol` contract code directly as it is battle tested and safe code.

 > While I agree this is an issue, I think the severity has been overstated slightly.  The transferFrom() function itself does not make any external calls so there is no exposure to reentrancy issues. That being said in the future if the contract had been extended in a way that enable an external call this would prove problematic.

> Since the sponsor has confirmed the issue _and_ this does violate well known best practices and open up the codebase to future issues, I will award the medium severity.

## [[M-02] Incorrect number of seconds in `ONE_YEAR` variable](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-paladin-findings/issues/4)
_Submitted by jayjonah8_

In `HolyPaladinToken.sol` the `ONE_YEAR` variable claims that there are `31557600` seconds in a year when this is incorrect.  The `ONE_YEAR` variable is used in the `getCurrentVotes()` function as well as the `getPastVotes()` function so it is vital that the correct time in seconds be used as it can effect users negatively.

### Proof of Concept

[HolyPaladinToken.sol#L25](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-paladin/blob/main/contracts/HolyPaladinToken.sol#L25)<br>

86,400 seconds in a day x 365 = 31\_536\_000

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The correct number of seconds in a year is 31\_536\_000 so the `ONE_YEAR` variable should be changed to `ONE_YEAR = 31_536_000`

## [[M-03] Users at `UNSTAKE_PERIOD` can assist other users in unstaking tokens.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-paladin-findings/issues/7)
_Submitted by cccz, also found by JC and gzeon_

Consider the following scenario:
Day 0: User A stakes 200 tokens and calls the cooldown function. At this time, user A's cooldown is Day 0.
Day 15: User B stakes 100 tokens, but then wants to unstake tokens. So user A said that he could assist user B in unstaking tokens, and this could be done by deploying a smart contract.
In the smart contract deployed by user A, user B first needs to transfer 100 tokens to user A. In the \_getNewReceiverCooldown function, \_senderCooldown is Day 15 and receiverCooldown is Day 0, so the latest cooldown of user A is (100 \* Day 15 + 200 \* Day 0)/(100+200) = Day 5.

        function _getNewReceiverCooldown(
            uint256 senderCooldown,
            uint256 amount,
            address receiver,
            uint256 receiverBalance
        ) internal view returns(uint256) {
            uint256 receiverCooldown = cooldowns[receiver];

            // If receiver has no cooldown, no need to set a new one
            if(receiverCooldown == 0) return 0;

            uint256 minValidCooldown = block.timestamp - (COOLDOWN_PERIOD + UNSTAKE_PERIOD);

            // If last receiver cooldown is expired, set it back to 0
            if(receiverCooldown < minValidCooldown) return 0;

            // In case the given senderCooldown is 0 (sender has no cooldown, or minting)
            uint256 _senderCooldown = senderCooldown < minValidCooldown ? block.timestamp : senderCooldown;

            // If the sender cooldown is better, we keep the receiver cooldown
            if(_senderCooldown < receiverCooldown) return receiverCooldown;

            // Default new cooldown, weighted average based on the amount and the previous balance
            return ((amount * _senderCooldown) + (receiverBalance * receiverCooldown)) / (amount + receiverBalance);

        }

Since User A is still at UNSTAKE_PERIOD after receiving the tokens, User A unstakes 100 tokens and sends it to User B.

After calculation, we found that when user A has a balance of X and is at the edge of UNSTAKE_PERIOD, user A can assist in unstaking the X/2 amount of tokens just staked.

### Proof of Concept

[HolyPaladinToken.sol#L1131](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-paladin/blob/main/contracts/HolyPaladinToken.sol#L1131)

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

After calculation, we found that the number of tokens that users at the edge of UNSTAKE_PERIOD can assist in unstaking conforms to the following equation
UNSTAKE_PERIOD/COOLDOWN_PERIOD = UNSTAKE_AMOUNT/USER_BALANCE, when COOLDOWN_PERIOD remains unchanged, the smaller the UNSTAKE_PERIOD, the less tokens the user can assist in unstaking, so UNSTAKE_PERIOD can be adjusted to alleviate this situation.

## [[M-04] `cooldown` is set to 0 when the user sends all tokens to himself](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-paladin-findings/issues/8)
_Submitted by cccz, also found by hyh and Czar102_

In the \_beforeTokenTransfer function, cooldowns will be set to 0 when the user transfers all tokens to himself.<br>
Consider the following scenario:<br>
Day 0: The user stakes 100 tokens and calls the cooldown function.<br>
Day 10: the user wanted to unstake the tokens, but accidentally transferred all the tokens to himself, which caused the cooldown to be set to 0 and the user could not unstake.

              require(amount <= _availableBalanceOf(from), "hPAL: Available balance too low");
          }

          // Update user rewards before any change on their balance (staked and locked)

              _updateUserRewards(to);
              // => we don't want a self-transfer to double count new claimable rewards
              // + no need to update the cooldown on a self-transfer

              uint256 previousToBalance = balanceOf(to);
              cooldowns[to] = _getNewReceiverCooldown(fromCooldown, amount, to, previousToBalance);
              // If from transfer all of its balance, reset the cooldown to 0
              uint256 previousFromBalance = balanceOf(from);
              if(previousFromBalance == amount && fromCooldown != 0) {
                  cooldowns[from] = 0;

4 kinds of states (`UserLock`, `TotalLock`, `Checkpoint`, `DelegateCheckpoint`) are maintained in the protocol to keep record of history. For functions that query history states, target block number is used as an index to search for the corresponding state.

However, 3 (`DelegateCheckpoint`, `TotalLock`, `UserLocks`) out of the 4 states are allowed to have multiple entries with same `fromBlock`, resulting in a one-to-many mapping between block number and history entry. This makes queried results at best imprecise, and at worst manipulatable by malicious users to present an incorrect history.

### Proof of Concept

Functions that query history states including `_getPastLock`, `getPastTotalLock`, `_getPastDelegate` perform a binary search through the array of history states to find entry matching queried block number. However, the searched arrays can contain multiple entries with the same `fromBlock`.

For example the `_lock` function pushes a new `UserLock` to `userLocks[user]` regardless of previous lock block number.

        function _lock(address user, uint256 amount, uint256 duration, LockAction action) internal {
            require(user != address(0)); //Never supposed to happen, but security check
            require(amount != 0, "hPAL: Null amount");
            uint256 userBalance = balanceOf(user);
            require(amount <= userBalance, "hPAL: Amount over balance");
            require(duration >= MIN_LOCK_DURATION, "hPAL: Lock duration under min");
            require(duration <= MAX_LOCK_DURATION, "hPAL: Lock duration over max");

            if(userLocks[user].length == 0){
                ...
            }
            else {
                // Get the current user Lock
                uint256 currentUserLockIndex = userLocks[user].length - 1;
                UserLock storage currentUserLock = userLocks[user][currentUserLockIndex];
                // Calculate the end of the user current lock
                uint256 userCurrentLockEnd = currentUserLock.startTimestamp + currentUserLock.duration;

                uint256 startTimestamp = block.timestamp;

                if(currentUserLock.amount == 0 || userCurrentLockEnd < block.timestamp) {
                    // User locked, and then unlocked
                    // or user lock expired

                    userLocks[user].push(UserLock(
                        safe128(amount),
                        safe48(startTimestamp),
                        safe48(duration),
                        safe32(block.number)
                    ));
                }
                else {
                    // Update of the current Lock : increase amount or increase duration
                    // or renew with the same parameters, but starting at the current timestamp
                    require(amount >=  currentUserLock.amount,"hPAL: smaller amount");
                    require(duration >=  currentUserLock.duration,"hPAL: smaller duration");

                    // If the method is called with INCREASE_AMOUNT, then we don't change the startTimestamp of the Lock

                    userLocks[user].push(UserLock(
                        safe128(amount),
                        action == LockAction.INCREASE_AMOUNT ? currentUserLock.startTimestamp : safe48(startTimestamp),
                        safe48(duration),
                        safe32(block.number)
                    ));
                    ...
                }
            ...
        }

This makes the history searches imprecise at best. Additionally, if a user intends to shadow his past states from queries through public search functions, it is possible to control the number of entries precisely such that binsearch returns the entry he wants to show.

### Tools Used

vim, ganache-cli

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Adopt the same strategy as checkpoint, and modify last entry in array instead of pushing new one if it `fromBlock == block.number`.

## [[M-06] `PaladinRewardReserve.sol` may have potential bugs if it uses new tokens as rewards](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-paladin-findings/issues/26)
_Submitted by TerrierLover_

`PaladinRewardReserve.sol` may have potential bugs if it uses new tokens as rewards.

### Proof of Concept

Currently, `PaladinRewardReserve.sol` has following behaviors:

*   `mapping(address => bool) public approvedSpenders` does not store the info regarding which token it targets
*   `setNewSpender`, `updateSpenderAllowance`, `removeSpender` and `transferToken` functions can set `token` arbitrarily

Hence, some corner cases may happen as follows:

*   Use TokenA at PaladinRewardReserve.sol and do operations.
*   Start TokenB as rewards at PaladinRewardReserve.sol.
*   All the information stored in `approvedSpenders` was intended for TokenA. So it is possible that following corner cases happen:
    *   `setNewSpender` function cannot set new token
    *   If userA is already added in `approvedSpenders` for TokenA, it can call `updateSpenderAllowance`.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Do either of followings depending on the product specification:

(1) If PAL token is only used and other token will never be used at `PaladinRewardReserve.sol`, stop having `address token` argument at `setNewSpender`, `updateSpenderAllowance`, `removeSpender` and `transferToken` functions. Instead, set `token` at the constructor or other ways, and limit the ability to flexibly set `token` from functions.

(2) If other tokens potentially will be used at `PaladinRewardReserve.sol`, update data structure of `approvedSpenders` mapping and change the logic.
Firstly, it should also contain the info which `token` it targets such as `mapping(address => address => bool)`.
Secondly, it should rewrite the `require` logic at each function as follows.

    require(!approvedSpenders[spender][token], "Already Spender on the specified Token");

<!---->

    require(approvedSpenders[spender][token], "Not approved Spender on the specified Token");

Function cooldown() is not protected when protocol is in emergency mode.<br>
Its behavior is not consistent with the other major functions defined.

### Impact

While other major functions like stake, unstake, lock, unlock, etc., of this contract is protected by checking for emergency flag and reverting,
this function cooldown() is not checked. The impact of this is that during emergency mode, users can set immediately the cooldown() and plan for unstaking when the emergency mode is lifted and cooldown period expires. This may not be the desirable behaviour expected by the protocol.

### Proof of Concept

Contract Name : HolyPaladinToken.sol
Function cooldown()

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add checking for emergency mode for this function also.

    if(emergency) revert EmergencyBlock();

## [[M-10] `UserLock` information can be found during emergency mode](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-paladin-findings/issues/59)

When the contract is in blocked state (emergency mode), the protocol wants to return an empty UserLock info, on calling the function getUserLock.
However, there is another way, by which the users can find the same information.

The below function is not protected when in emergency mode, and users can use this alternatively.
Line#466 function getUserPastLock(address user, uint256 blockNumber)

### Impact

There is no loss of funds, however the intention to block information (return empty lock info) is defeated, because not all functions are protected.<br>
There is inconsistency in implementing the emergency mode check.

### Proof of Concept

Contract Name : HolyPaladinToken.sol<br>
Functions getUserLock and getUserPastLock

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add checking for emergency mode for this function getUserPastLock.

    if(emergency) revert EmergencyBlock();

Additional user access check can be added, so that the function returns correct value when the caller(msg.sender) is admin or owner.

_Submitted by reassor_

Enabling emergency mode should be one way process that sets contract(s) in emergency mode. It should be not possible to revert that process, otherwise it puts owner of the contract(s) in very privileged position. Owner can trigger emergency mode, perform emergency withdrawal operations without any restrictions and then disable emergency mode.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

It is recommended to remove `bool trigger` parameter from `triggerEmergencyWithdraw` function and set `emergency` to `true` after successfully executing function.

## [[M-12] Users with large `cooldown`s can grief other users](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-paladin-findings/issues/69)
_Submitted by IllIllI, also found by 0xDjango and csanuragjain_

If an account has a large cooldown, that account can grief other accounts that are waiting for their own cooldowns, by sending small amounts to them.

### Proof of Concept

Every transfer to an account increases the cooldown

```solidity
    /** @dev Hook called before any transfer */
    function _beforeTokenTransfer(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal virtual override {
        if(from != address(0)) { //check must be skipped on minting
            // Only allow the balance that is unlocked to be transfered
            require(amount <= _availableBalanceOf(from), "hPAL: Available balance too low");
        }

        // Update user rewards before any change on their balance (staked and locked)
        _updateUserRewards(from);

        uint256 fromCooldown = cooldowns[from]; //If from is address 0x00...0, cooldown is always 0 

        if(from != to) {
            // Update user rewards before any change on their balance (staked and locked)
            _updateUserRewards(to);
            // => we don't want a self-transfer to double count new claimable rewards
            // + no need to update the cooldown on a self-transfer

            uint256 previousToBalance = balanceOf(to);
            cooldowns[to] = _getNewReceiverCooldown(fromCooldown, amount, to, previousToBalance);
        }
```

[HolyPaladinToken.sol#L875-L899](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-paladin/blob/9c26ec8556298fb1dc3cf71f471aadad3a5c74a0/contracts/HolyPaladinToken.sol#L875-L899)<br>

The amount of the increase is proportional to the sender's cooldown:

```solidity
        // Default new cooldown, weighted average based on the amount and the previous balance
        return ((amount * _senderCooldown) + (receiverBalance * receiverCooldown)) / (amount + receiverBalance);
```

[HolyPaladinToken.sol#L1130-L1131](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-paladin/blob/9c26ec8556298fb1dc3cf71f471aadad3a5c74a0/contracts/HolyPaladinToken.sol#L1130-L1131)<br>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Only allow a total of one cooldown increase when the sender is not the recipient.

## [[M-13] Users Can Bypass Emergency Restrictions on `updateUserRewardState()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-paladin-findings/issues/94)
_Submitted by leastwood_

The `emergencyWithdraw()` function intends to withdraw their tokens regardless if they are locked up for any duration. This emergency must be triggered by the owner of the contract by calling `triggerEmergencyWithdraw()`. A number of functions will revert when the protocol is in an emergency state, including all stake, lock, unlock and kick actions and the updating of a user's rewards. However, a user could bypass the restriction on `_updateUserRewards()` by transferring a small amount of unlocked tokens to their account. `_beforeTokenTransfer()` will call `_updateUserRewards()` on the `from` and `to` accounts. As a result, users can continue to accrue rewards while the protocol is in an emergency state and it makes sense for users to delay their emergency withdraw as they will be able to claim a higher proportion of the allocated rewards.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider adding a check for the boolean `emergency` value in `_beforeTokenTransfer()` to not call `_updateUserRewards` on any account if this value is set. Alternatively, a check could be added into the `_updateUserRewards()` function to return if `emergency` is true.

## [[M-14] Increasing the Lock Amount on an Expired Lock Will Cause Users to Miss Out on Rewards](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-paladin-findings/issues/95)

Paladin protocol allows users to increase the amount or duration of their lock while it is stil active. Increasing the amount of an active lock should only increase the total locked amount and it shouldn't make any changes to the associated bonus ratios as the duration remains unchanged.

However, if a user increases the lock amount on an expired lock, a new lock will be created with the duration of the previous lock and the provided non-zero amount. Because the `action != LockAction.INCREASE_AMOUNT` check later on in the function does not hold true, `userCurrentBonusRatio` will contain the last updated value from the previous lock. As a result, the user will not receive any rewards for their active lock and they will need to increase the duration of the lock to fix lock's bonus ratio.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider preventing users from increasing the amount on an expired lock. This should help to mitigate this issue.

## [L-01] `PaladinRewardReserve`'s approvals break if the same contract is in charge of two tokens (e.g. a [PalPool](https://doc.paladin.vote/paladin-protocol/palpool))

The `approvedSpenders` mapping only takes in a spender, rather than both a spender and a token. Approval for one token means approval for all tokens the account controls. Removal for one means removal for all.

## [G-03] Usage of `Errors` can reduce gas cost and contract size at PaladinRewardReserve.sol

### Target codebase

[PaladinRewardReserve.sol#L29](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-paladin/blob/9c26ec8556298fb1dc3cf71f471aadad3a5c74a0/contracts/PaladinRewardReserve.sol#L29)<br>

It uses `require` but using [`Errors`](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/contracts.html?highlight=error#errors-and-the-revert-statement) in solidity can reduce the deployment gas cost.

### Potential improvements

    // Define error 
    error AlreadySpender();
    error NotApprovedSpender();

    // Update the logic accordingly
    if (approvedSpenders[spender]) {
        revert AlreadySpender();
    }

    if (!approvedSpenders[spender]) {
        revert NotApprovedSpender();

## [G-04] No need to set false at `emergency` variable in HolyPaladinToken.sol

### Target codebase

[HolyPaladinToken.sol#L103](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-paladin/blob/9c26ec8556298fb1dc3cf71f471aadad3a5c74a0/contracts/HolyPaladinToken.sol#L103)<br>

### Potential improvements

The default value of bool is false. So there is no need to set false at `emergency` variable.

    bool public emergency;

### Deployment Gas change

## [G-05] Usage of `Errors` can reduce gas cost and contract size at HolyPaladinToken.sol

### Target codebase

Where it uses `require` in [`HolyPaladinToken.sol`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-paladin/blob/9c26ec8556298fb1dc3cf71f471aadad3a5c74a0/contracts/HolyPaladinToken.sol).<br>

There are 39 callers of `require`.

### Potential improvements

Use `Errors` instead of `require`. [(Errors and the Revert Statement)](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/contracts.html?highlight=error#errors-and-the-revert-statement).<br>

The gas and size improvements after using `Errors` instead of `require` with "hPAL: No Lock" is shown below:

    // Before change
    require(..., "hPAL: No Lock");

    // After change
    if (...) revert NoLock();

There are 8 callers of `require(..., "hPAL: No Lock")`.<br>

### Potential improvements

Use `!= 0` instead of `> 0` at the above mentioned codes. The variable is uint, so it will not be below 0 so it can just check `!= 0`.

    require(balanceOf(msg.sender) != 0, "hPAL: No balance");

### Methods Gas change

Following methods in HolyPaladinToken.sol can reduce gas (from 5 to 20) by the above mentioned changes.

*   claim function
*   cooldown function
*   emergencyWithdraw function
*   increaseLock function
*   increaseLockDuration function
*   kick function
*   lock function
*   stake function
*   stakeAndIncreaseLock function

## [G-07] Usage of unchecked can reduce the gas cost at claim function at  HolyPaladinToken.sol

### Target codebase

[HolyPaladinToken.sol#L392](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-paladin/blob/9c26ec8556298fb1dc3cf71f471aadad3a5c74a0/contracts/HolyPaladinToken.sol#L392)<br>

    // Cannot claim more than accrued rewards, but we can use a higher amount to claim all the rewards
    uint256 claimAmount = amount < claimableRewards[msg.sender] ? amount : claimableRewards[msg.sender];

    // remove the claimed amount from the claimable mapping for the user, 
    // and transfer the PAL from the rewardsVault to the user
    claimableRewards[msg.sender] -= claimAmount;

`claimAmount` will not be more than `claimableRewards[msg.sender]`. Therefore, `claimableRewards[msg.sender] -= claimAmount` can be wrapped by unchecked.

### Potential improvements

Wrap `claimableRewards[msg.sender] -= claimAmount` with unchecked.

    // Cannot claim more than accrued rewards, but we can use a higher amount to claim all the rewards
    uint256 claimAmount = amount < claimableRewards[msg.sender] ? amount : claimableRewards[msg.sender];

    // remove the claimed amount from the claimable mapping for the user,

## [G-08] The usage of unchecked in average function in Math.sol can reduce deployment gas fee and contract size of HolyPaladinToken.sol

### Target codebase

[Math.sol#L29](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-paladin/blob/main/contracts/open-zeppelin/utils/Math.sol#L29)<br>

                        bonusRatioDecrease = previousBonusRatio;
                        // In the case this update is made far after the end of the lock, this method would mean
                        // the user could get a multiplier for longer than expected
                        // We count on the Kick logic to avoid that scenario
                    }

                    // and calculate the locking rewards based on the locked balance & 
                    // a ratio based on the rpevious one and the newly calculated one
                    uint256 periodBonusRatio = newBonusRatio + ((userRatioDecrease + bonusRatioDecrease) / 2);
                    lockingRewards = (userLockedBalance * ((indexDiff * periodBonusRatio) / UNIT)) / UNIT;
                }
            }

        }
        // sum up the accrued rewards, and return it
        accruedRewards = (userStakedBalance * indexDiff) / UNIT + lockingRewards;
    }

In this example, it also does not define `userStakedBalance` variable.
