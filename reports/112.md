# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Backd smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between April 21—April 27 2022.

## Wardens

62 Wardens contributed reports to the Backd contest:

Additionally, C4 analysis included 39 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 35 reports recommending gas optimizations.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Backd contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd), and is composed of 38 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 4,630 lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

# High Risk Findings (3)
## [[H-01] User can steal all rewards due to checkpoint after transfer](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd-findings/issues/36)
_Submitted by 0xDjango, also found by unforgiven_

[StakerVault.sol#L112-L119](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd/blob/c856714a50437cb33240a5964b63687c9876275b/backd/contracts/StakerVault.sol#L112-L119)<br>

I believe this to be a high severity vulnerability that is potentially included in the currently deployed `StakerVault.sol` contract also. The team will be contacted immediately following the submission of this report.

In `StakerVault.sol`, the user checkpoints occur AFTER the balances are updated in the `transfer()` function. The user checkpoints update the amount of rewards claimable by the user. Since their rewards will be updated after transfer, a user can send funds between their own accounts and repeatedly claim maximum rewards since the pool's inception.

In every actionable function except `transfer()` of `StakerVault.sol`, a call to `ILpGauge(lpGauge).userCheckpoint()` is correctly made BEFORE the action effects.

### Proof of Concept

Assume a certain period of time has passed since the pool's inception. For easy accounting, assume `poolStakedIntegral` of `LpGauge.sol` equals `1`. The `poolStakedIntegral` is used to keep track of the current reward rate.

Steps:

*   Account A stakes 1000 LP tokens. `balances[A] += 1000`
*   In the same `stakeFor()` function, `userCheckpoint()` was already called so A will already have `perUserShare[A]` set correctly based on their previously 0 balance and the current `poolStakedIntegral`.
*   Account A can immediately send all balance to Account B via `transfer()`.
*   Since the checkpoint occurs after the transfer, B's balance will increase and then `perUserShare[B]` will be updated. The calculation for `perUserShare` looks as follows.

<!---->
```solidity
perUserShare[user] += (
            (stakerVault.stakedAndActionLockedBalanceOf(user)).scaledMul(
                (poolStakedIntegral_ - perUserStakedIntegral[user])
            )
        );
```

Assuming Account B is new to the protocol, their `perUserStakedIntegral[user]` will default to `0`.

`perUserShare[B] += 1000 * (1 - 0) = 1000`

*   B is able to call `claimRewards()` and mint all 1000 reward tokens.
*   B then calls `transfer()` and sends all 1000 staked tokens to Account C.
*   Same calculation occurs, and C can claim all 1000 reward tokens.
*   This process can be repeated until the contract is drained of reward tokens.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

In `StakerVault.transfer()`, move the call to `ILpGauge(lpGauge).userCheckpoint()` to before the balances are updated.

## [[H-02] function `lockFunds` in `TopUpActionLibrary` can cause serious fund lose. fee and Capped bypass. It's not calling `stakerVault.increaseActionLockedBalance` when transfers stakes.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd-findings/issues/60)
_Submitted by unforgiven_

[TopUpAction.sol#L57-L65](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd/blob/c856714a50437cb33240a5964b63687c9876275b/backd/contracts/actions/topup/TopUpAction.sol#L57-L65)<br>

In function TopUpActionLibrary.lockFunds when transfers stakes from payer it doesn't call stakerVault.increaseActionLockedBalance for that payer so stakerVault.actionLockedBalances\[payer] is not get updated for payer and stakerVault.stakedAndActionLockedBalanceOf(payer) is going to show wrong value and any calculation based on this function is gonna be wrong which will cause fund lose and theft and some restriction bypasses.

### Proof of Concept

When user wants to create a TopUpAction. so he deposit his funds to Pool and get LP token. then stake the LP token in StakerVault and use that stakes to create a TopUp position with function TopUpAction.register. This function transfer user stakes (locks user staks) and create his position.<br>

For transferring and locking user stakes it uses TopUpActionLibrary.lockFunds. function lockFunds transfers user stakes but don't call stakerVault.increaseActionLockedBalance for the payer which cause that stakerVault.actionLockedBalances\[payer] to get different values(not equal to position.depositTokenBalance).<br>

Function StakerVault.stakedAndActionLockedBalanceOf(account) uses stakerVault.actionLockedBalances\[account] so it will return wrong value and any where in code that uses stakedAndActionLockedBalanceOf() is going to cause problems.<br>

three part of the codes uses stakerVault.stakedAndActionLockedBalanceOf():<br>
1. LiqudityPool.depositFor() for checking user total deposits to be less than depositCap.<br>
2. LiqudityPool.\_updateUserFeesOnDeposit() for updating user fee on new deposits.<br>
3. userCheckpoint() for calculating user rewards.<br>
attacker can use #1 and #2 to bypass high fee payment and max depositCap and #3 will cause users to lose
rewards.<br>

The detail steps:<br>
1- user deposit fund to Pool and get LP token.<br>
2- user stakes LP token in StakerVault.<br>
3- user approve TopUpAction address to transfer his staks in StakerVault.<br>
3- user use all his stakes to create a position with TopUpAction.register() function.<br>
3.1- register() will call lockFunds to transfer and lock user stakes.<br>
3.2- lockFunds() will transfer user stakes with stakerVault.transferFrom() but don't call stakerVault.increaseActionLockedBalance() so StakerVault.actionLockedBalances\[user] will be zero.<br>
3.3- StakerVault.balance\[useer] will be zero too because his stakes get transfers in 3.2<br>
4- StakerVault.stakedAndActionLockedBalanceOf(user) will return zero (user has some locked stakes in TopUpAction but because of the bug calculation get out of sync)<br>

In this moment user will lose all the rewards that are minted in LpGauge. because userCheckpoint() use stakerVault.stakedAndActionLockedBalanceOf(user) for calculating rewards which is zero  and new rewards will be zero too.<br>

Attacker can use this process to bypass "max deposit Cap" and deposit any amount of assets he wants. because LiqudityPool.depositFor(address,uint256,uint256) uses stakedAndActionLockedBalanceOf to check user deposits which is zero so Attacker can deposit & stake & register to make his balance zero and repeat this and in the end reset his TopUp positions to get back his large stakes which are multiple time bigger than "max deposit Cap"

Attacker can also use this process to bypass fee penalties for early withdraw. because LiqudityPool.\_updateUserFeesOnDeposit() to get user current balance use stakedAndActionLockedBalanceOf() which is zero. so the value of shareExisting variable become zero and newFeeRatio will be calculated based on feeOnDeposit which can be minFee if asset is already in wallet for some time.

### Tools Used

VIM

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add this line to TopUpActionLibrary.lockFunds() after stakerVault.transferFrom():

stakerVault.increaseActionLockedBalance(payer, amountLeft);

[TopUpAction.sol#L847](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd/blob/c856714a50437cb33240a5964b63687c9876275b/backd/contracts/actions/topup/TopUpAction.sol#L847)<br>

OpenZeppelin's `safeApprove()` will revert if the account already is approved and the new `safeApprove()` is done with a non-zero value.

```solidity
function safeApprove(
    IERC20 token,
    address spender,
    uint256 value
) internal {
    // safeApprove should only be called when setting an initial allowance,
    // or when resetting it to zero. To increase and decrease it, use
    // 'safeIncreaseAllowance' and 'safeDecreaseAllowance'
    require(
        (value == 0) || (token.allowance(address(this), spender) == 0),
        "SafeERC20: approve from non-zero to non-zero allowance"
    );
    _callOptionalReturn(token, abi.encodeWithSelector(token.approve.selector, spender, value));
}
```

[OpenZeppelin/SafeERC20.sol#L45-L58](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/fcf35e5722847f5eadaaee052968a8a54d03622a/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L45-L58)<br>

### Impact

Customers cannot be topped up a second time, which will cause them to be liquidated even though they think they're protected.

### Proof of Concept

There are multiple places where `safeApprove()` is called a second time without setting the value to zero first. The instances below are all related to topping up.

Compound-specific top-ups will fail the second time around when approving the `ctoken` again:

```solidity
File: backd/contracts/actions/topup/handlers/CompoundHandler.sol   #1

50       function topUp(
51           bytes32 account,
52           address underlying,
53           uint256 amount,
54           bytes memory extra
55       ) external override returns (bool) {
56           bool repayDebt = abi.decode(extra, (bool));
57           CToken ctoken = cTokenRegistry.fetchCToken(underlying);
58           uint256 initialTokens = ctoken.balanceOf(address(this));
59   
60           address addr = account.addr();
61   
62           if (repayDebt) {
63               amount -= _repayAnyDebt(addr, underlying, amount, ctoken);
64               if (amount == 0) return true;
65           }
66   
67           uint256 err;
68           if (underlying == address(0)) {
69               err = ctoken.mint{value: amount}(amount);
70           } else {
71               IERC20(underlying).safeApprove(address(ctoken), amount);
```

[CompoundHandler.sol#L50-L71](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd/blob/c856714a50437cb33240a5964b63687c9876275b/backd/contracts/actions/topup/handlers/CompoundHandler.sol#L50-L71)<br>

Compound-specific top-ups will also fail when trying to repay debt:

```solidity
File: backd/contracts/actions/topup/handlers/CompoundHandler.sol   #2

62           if (repayDebt) {
63               amount -= _repayAnyDebt(addr, underlying, amount, ctoken);
64               if (amount == 0) return true;
65           }
```

[CompoundHandler.sol#L62-L65](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd/blob/c856714a50437cb33240a5964b63687c9876275b/backd/contracts/actions/topup/handlers/CompoundHandler.sol#L62-L65)<br>

Aave-specific top-ups will fail for the `lendingPool`:

```solidity
File: backd/contracts/actions/topup/handlers/AaveHandler.sol   #3

36       function topUp(
37           bytes32 account,
38           address underlying,
39           uint256 amount,
40           bytes memory extra
41       ) external override returns (bool) {
42           bool repayDebt = abi.decode(extra, (bool));
43           if (underlying == address(0)) {
44               weth.deposit{value: amount}();
45               underlying = address(weth);
46           }
47   
48           address addr = account.addr();
49   
50           DataTypes.ReserveData memory reserve = lendingPool.getReserveData(underlying);
51           require(reserve.aTokenAddress != address(0), Error.UNDERLYING_NOT_SUPPORTED);
52   
53           IERC20(underlying).safeApprove(address(lendingPool), amount);
```

[AaveHandler.sol#L36-L53](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd/blob/c856714a50437cb33240a5964b63687c9876275b/backd/contracts/actions/topup/handlers/AaveHandler.sol#L36-L53)<br>

The `TopUpAction` itself fails for the `feeHandler`:

```solidity
File: backd/contracts/actions/topup/TopUpAction.sol   #4

840       function _payFees(
841           address payer,
842           address beneficiary,
843           uint256 feeAmount,
844           address depositToken
845       ) internal {
846           address feeHandler = getFeeHandler();
847           IERC20(depositToken).safeApprove(feeHandler, feeAmount);
```

[TopUpAction.sol#L840-L847](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd/blob/c856714a50437cb33240a5964b63687c9876275b/backd/contracts/actions/topup/TopUpAction.sol#L840-L847)<br>

I've filed the other less-severe instances as a separate medium-severity issue, and flagged the remaining low-severity instances in my QA report.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Always do `safeApprove(0)` if the allowance is being changed, or use `safeIncreaseAllowance()`.

# Medium Risk Findings (15)
## [[M-01] `call()` should be used instead of `transfer()` on an `address payable`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd-findings/issues/52)
_Submitted by Dravee, also found by antonttc, berndartmueller, cccz, danb, horsefacts, hyh, IllIllI, MaratCerby, pauliax, rayn, UnusualTurtle, WatchPug, and wuwe1_

This is a classic Code4rena issue:

*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-04-meebits-findings/issues/2>
*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-10-tally-findings/issues/20>
*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-openleverage-findings/issues/75>

### Impact

The use of the deprecated `transfer()` function for an address will inevitably make the transaction fail when:

1.  The claimer smart contract does not implement a payable function.
2.  The claimer smart contract does implement a payable fallback which uses more than 2300 gas unit.
3.  The claimer smart contract implements a payable fallback function that needs less than 2300 gas units but is called through proxy, raising the call's gas usage above 2300.

Additionally, using higher than 2300 gas might be mandatory for some multisig wallets.

#### Impacted lines:

```solidity
backd/contracts/pool/EthPool.sol:
  30:         to.transfer(amount);

backd/contracts/strategies/BkdEthCvx.sol:
   77:             payable(vault).transfer(amount);
   93:         payable(vault).transfer(amount);
  117:         payable(vault).transfer(underlyingBalance);

backd/contracts/vault/EthVault.sol:
  29:         payable(to).transfer(amount); 
  37:         payable(addressProvider.getTreasury()).transfer(amount);  

backd/contracts/vault/VaultReserve.sol:
  81:             payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
```

### Recommended Mitigation

I recommend using `call()` instead of `transfer()`.

## [[M-02] Its possible to lose total governance control by mistake](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd-findings/issues/83)
_Submitted by hubble, also found by antonttc, csanuragjain, gs8nrv, rayn, reassor, and TrungOre_

[RoleManager.sol#L43-L46](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd/blob/c856714a50437cb33240a5964b63687c9876275b/backd/contracts/access/RoleManager.sol#L43-L46)<br>

The impact of this vulnerability, i.e.,  losing all governance control is very High.<br>
There is a possibility, due to a corner case as described below.<br>

### Proof of Concept
Contract : RoleManager.sol<br>
Function : renounceGovernance()<br>
```
   Step 0:
     Let current governance role given to = CURRENT_GOV_ADDRESS
     so, getRoleMemberCount() for "governance" role will return = 1 

   Step 1: Add a new address say ALICE to governance role, by addGovernor(ALICE)
     now, ALICE also has governace role, and getRoleMemberCount() for "governance" role will return = 2 
   
   Step 2: Assume that ALICE renounces governance role, by renounceGovernance()
     now, ALICE does not have governance role, but getRoleMemberCount() for "governance" role will return = 2, due to a BUG

   Step 3: In some distant future, if there is a compromise of CURRENT_GOV_ADDRESS keys or due to some other reason, 
     its decided to revoke governance role for CURRENT_GOV_ADDRESS via renounceGovernance(), and the command succeeds
     It can be assumed that since getRoleMemberCount() for "governance" role returns = 2, at least there is one other active governor address. 
     But now, CURRENT_GOV_ADDRESS does not have governance role, and the total governance control on the protocol is lost my mistake.
```
### Recommended Mitigation Steps
getRoleMemberCount() currently returns _roleMembers[role].length();<br>
  It should return the count only for _roles[role].members[account] = true;<br>

Its recommended to add a new function to know who are the active members for any role,<br>
  like getRoleMembers(bytes32 role) returning address account.

OpenZeppelin's `safeApprove()` will revert if the account already is approved and the new `safeApprove()` is done with a non-zero value

```solidity
    function safeApprove(
        IERC20 token,
        address spender,
        uint256 value
    ) internal {
        // safeApprove should only be called when setting an initial allowance,
        // or when resetting it to zero. To increase and decrease it, use
        // 'safeIncreaseAllowance' and 'safeDecreaseAllowance'
        require(
            (value == 0) || (token.allowance(address(this), spender) == 0),
            "SafeERC20: approve from non-zero to non-zero allowance"
        );

    }
```

### Impact

Customers can be prevented from `register()`ing the same `token`/`stakerVaultAddress` as another customer; and once changed away from, stakers and lptokens can't be used in the future.

### Proof of Concept

There are multiple places where `safeApprove()` is called a second time without setting the value to zero first.

`register()` calls `lockFunds()` for each user registration, and since users will use the same tokens and staker vaults, the second user's `register()` call will fail:

```solidity
File: backd/contracts/actions/topup/TopUpAction.sol   #1

36       function lockFunds(
37           address stakerVaultAddress,
38           address payer,
39           address token,
40           uint256 lockAmount,
41           uint256 depositAmount
42       ) external {
43           uint256 amountLeft = lockAmount;
44           IStakerVault stakerVault = IStakerVault(stakerVaultAddress);
45   
46           // stake deposit amount
47           if (depositAmount > 0) {
48               depositAmount = depositAmount > amountLeft ? amountLeft : depositAmount;
49               IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(payer, address(this), depositAmount);
50               IERC20(token).safeApprove(stakerVaultAddress, depositAmount);
```

[TopUpAction.sol#L36-L50](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd/blob/c856714a50437cb33240a5964b63687c9876275b/backd/contracts/actions/topup/TopUpAction.sol#L36-L50)<br>

The changing of either the staker or an lp token is behind a time-lock, and once the time has passed, the changed variables rely on this function:

```solidity
File: backd/contracts/pool/LiquidityPool.sol   #2

717       function _approveStakerVaultSpendingLpTokens() internal {
718           address staker_ = address(staker);
719           address lpToken_ = address(lpToken);
720           if (staker_ == address(0) || lpToken_ == address(0)) return;
721           IERC20(lpToken_).safeApprove(staker_, type(uint256).max);
722       }
```

[LiquidityPool.sol#L717-L722](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd/blob/c856714a50437cb33240a5964b63687c9876275b/backd/contracts/pool/LiquidityPool.sol#L717-L722)<br>

If a bug is found in a new `staker` or `lpToken` and the governor wishes to change back to the old one(s), the governor will have to wait for the time-lock delay only to find out that the old value(s) cause the code to revert.

I've filed the other more-severe instances as a separate high-severity issue, and flagged the remaining low-severity instances in my QA report.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Always do `safeApprove(0)` if the allowance is being changed, or use `safeIncreaseAllowance()`.

 > It should be noted that the second example referring to `_approveStakerVaultSpendingLpTokens()` is not an issue. This is neither a member variable that can be updated nor is it behind a time lock. Both the `staker` and `lpToken` can only be set once and hence the `safeApprove` in the aforementioned function can only be called once.

## [[M-04] `CvxCrvRewardsLocker` implements a swap without a slippage check that can result in a loss of funds through MEV](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd-findings/issues/161)
_Submitted by Ruhum_

The CvxCrvRewardsLocker contract swaps tokens through the CRV cvxCRV pool. But, it doesn't use any slippage checks. The swap is at risk of being frontrun / sandwiched which will result in a loss of funds.

Since MEV is very prominent I think the chance of that happening is pretty high.

### Proof of Concept

Here's the swap: [CvxCrvRewardsLocker.sol#L247-L252](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd/blob/c856714a50437cb33240a5964b63687c9876275b/backd/contracts/CvxCrvRewardsLocker.sol#L247-L252).

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Use a proper value for `minOut` instead of `0`.

## [[M-06] ERC777 tokens can bypass `depositCap` guard](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd-findings/issues/47)
_Submitted by shenwilly, also found by wuwe1_

[LiquidityPool.sol#L523](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd/blob/c856714a50437cb33240a5964b63687c9876275b/backd/contracts/pool/LiquidityPool.sol#L523)<br>

When ERC777 token is used as the underlying token for a `LiquidityPool`, a depositor can reenter `depositFor` and bypass the `depositCap` requirement check, resulting in higher total deposit than intended by governance.

### Proof of Concept

*   An empty ERC777 liquidity pool is capped at 1.000 token.
*   Alice deposits 1.000 token. Before the token is actually sent to the contract, `tokensToSend` ERC777 hook is called and Alice reenters `depositFor`.
*   As the previous deposit hasn't been taken into account, the reentrancy passes the `depositCap` check.
*   Pool has 2.000 token now, despite the 1.000 deposit cap.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add reentrancy guards to `depositFor`.

In `StrategySwapper`, swapping from or to tokens with decimals higher than 18 will always revert. This will cause inabilities for strategies to harvest rewards.

### Proof of Concept

[L288](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd/blob/c856714a50437cb33240a5964b63687c9876275b/backd/contracts/strategies/StrategySwapper.sol#L288) will revert when `token_` has higher than 18 decimals.

     return 10**(18 - IERC20Full(token_).decimals());

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider modifying how `_decimalMultiplier` works so it could handle tokens with higher than 18 decimals.

Update the calculation of `_minTokenAmountOut` and `_minWethAmountOut` to account when decimals are higher/lower than `18`.

## [[M-09] `getNewCurrentFees` reverts when `minFeePercentage` > `feeRatio`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd-findings/issues/50)
_Submitted by shenwilly_

[LiquidityPool.sol#L694](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd/blob/c856714a50437cb33240a5964b63687c9876275b/backd/contracts/pool/LiquidityPool.sol#L694)<br>

Depositors won't be able to transfer or redeem funds temporarily.

The problem is caused by the implementation of `LiquidityPool.getNewCurrentFees`:
```solidity
function getNewCurrentFees(
    uint256 timeToWait,
    uint256 lastActionTimestamp,
    uint256 feeRatio
) public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 timeElapsed = _getTime() - lastActionTimestamp;
    uint256 minFeePercentage = getMinWithdrawalFee();
    if (timeElapsed >= timeToWait) {
        return minFeePercentage;
    }
    uint256 elapsedShare = timeElapsed.scaledDiv(timeToWait);
    return feeRatio - (feeRatio - minFeePercentage).scaledMul(elapsedShare);
}
```

The last line requires the current `feeRatio` to be higher than `minFeePercentage` or the function will revert. When this condition is broken, some critical functions such as transferring tokens and redeeming will be unusable. Affected users need to wait until enough time has elapsed and `getNewCurrentFees` returns `minFeePercentage` on [L691](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd/blob/c856714a50437cb33240a5964b63687c9876275b/backd/contracts/pool/LiquidityPool.sol#L691).

This could happen if governance changes the `MinWithdrawalFee` to be higher than a user's feeRatio.

### Proof of Concept

*   Initial `MinWithdrawalFee` is set to 0, `MaxWithdrawalFee` is set to 0.03e18.
*   Alice deposits fund and receives LP token. Alice's `feeRatio` is now set to 0.03e18 (the current `MaxWithdrawalFee`).
*   Governance changes `MaxWithdrawalFee` to `0.05e18` and `MinWithdrawalFee` to `0.04e18`.
*   `minFeePercentage` is now higher than Alice's `feeRatio` and she can't transfer nor redeem the LP token until `timeElapsed >= timeToWait`.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a new condition in `getNewCurrentFees` [L690](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd/blob/c856714a50437cb33240a5964b63687c9876275b/backd/contracts/pool/LiquidityPool.sol#L690) to account for this case:

```solidity
if (timeElapsed >= timeToWait || minFeePercentage > feeRatio) {
    return minFeePercentage;
}

## [[M-10] Griefer can extend period of higher withdrawal fees](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd-findings/issues/56)
_Submitted by 0xDjango_

[LiquidityPool.sol#L790-L792](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd/blob/c856714a50437cb33240a5964b63687c9876275b/backd/contracts/pool/LiquidityPool.sol#L790-L792)<br>

The `_updateUserFeesOnDeposit()` function in `LiquidityPool.sol` is used to update a user's withdrawal fees after an action such as deposit, transfer in, etc. The withdrawal fee decays toward a minimum withdrawal fee over a period of 1 or 2 weeks (discussed with developer). Since anyone can transfer lp tokens to any user, a griefer can transfer 1 wei of lp tokens to another user to reset their `lastActionTimestamp` used in the withdrawal fee calculation.

The developers nicely weight the updated withdrawal fee by taking the original balance/original fee vs the added balance/added fee. The attacker will only be able to extend the runway of the withdrawal fee cooldown by resetting the `lastActionTimestamp` for future calculations. Example below:

### Proof of Concept
Assumptions:
- MinWithdrawalFee = 0% //For easy math
- MaxWithdrawalFee = 10%
- timeToWait = 2 weeks

#### Steps
- User A has `100 wei` of shares
- User A waits 1 week (Current withdrawal fee = 5%)
- User B deposits, receives `1 wei` of shares, current withdrawal fee = 10%
- User B immediately transfers `1 wei` of shares to User A

Based on the formula to calculated User A's new feeRatio:

```solidity
uint256 newFeeRatio = shareExisting.scaledMul(newCurrentFeeRatio) +
    shareAdded.scaledMul(feeOnDeposit);
```

In reality, User A's withdrawal fee will only increase by a negligible amount since the shares added were very small in proportion to the original shares. We can assume user A's current withdrawal fee is still 5%.

The issue is that the function then reset's User A's `lastActionTimestamp` to the current time. This means that User A will have to wait the maximum 2 weeks for the withdrawal fee to reduce from 5% to 0%. Effectively the cooldown runway is the same length as the original runway length, so the decay down to 0% will take twice as long.

`meta.lastActionTimestamp = uint64(_getTime());`

### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Instead of resetting `lastActionTimestamp` to the current time, scale it the same way the `feeRatio` is scaled. I understand that this would technically not be the timestamp of the last action, so the variable would probably need to be renamed.

The default swap slippage of 5% allows malicious keepers to sandwich attack topup. Additionally, up to 40% (\_MIN_SWAPPER_SLIPPAGE) slippage allows malicious owner to sandwich huge amounts from topup

### Proof of Concept

Keeper can bundle swaps before and after topup to sandwich topup action, in fact it's actually in their best interest to do so.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Allow user to specify max swap slippage when creating topup similar to how it's specified on uniswap or sushiswap to block attacks from both keepers and owners.

## [[M-12] `CompoundHandler#topUp()` Using the wrong function selector makes native token `topUp()` always revert](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd-findings/issues/120)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

[compound-finance/CEther.sol#L44-L47](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/v2.8.1/contracts/CEther.sol#L44-L47)<br>

```solidity
function mint() external payable {
    (uint err,) = mintInternal(msg.value);
    requireNoError(err, "mint failed");
}
```

`mint()` for native cToken (`CEther`) does not have any parameters, as the `Function Selector` is based on `the function name with the parenthesised list of parameter types`, when you add a nonexisting `parameter`, the `Function Selector` will be incorrect.

[CTokenInterfaces.sol#L316](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd/blob/c856714a50437cb33240a5964b63687c9876275b/backd/interfaces/vendor/CTokenInterfaces.sol#L316)<br>

```solidity
function mint(uint256 mintAmount) external payable virtual returns (uint256);
```

The current implementation uses the same `CToken` interface for both `CEther` and `CErc20` in `topUp()`, and `function mint(uint256 mintAmount)` is a nonexisting function for `CEther`.

As a result, the native token `topUp()` always revert.

`mint()` for native cToken (`CEther`) will return nothing, while the current `CEthInterface` interface defines the returns as `(uint256)`.

In the current implementation, the interface for `CToken` is used for both `CEther` and `CErc20`.

As a result, the transaction will revert with the error: `function returned an unexpected amount of data` when `topUp()` with the native token (ETH).

## [[M-15] Malicious Stakers can grief Keepers](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd-findings/issues/194)
_Submitted by sseefried_

A Staker -- that has their top-up position removed after `execute` is called by a Keeper -- can always cause the transaction to revert. They can do this by deploying a smart contract to the `payer` address that has implemented a `receive()` function that calls `revert()`. The revert will be triggered by the following [lines](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd/blob/c856714a50437cb33240a5964b63687c9876275b/backd/contracts/actions/topup/TopUpAction.sol#L727-L729) in `execute`

```solidity
if (vars.removePosition) {
    gasBank.withdrawUnused(payer);
}
```

This will consume some gas from the keeper while preventing them accruing any rewards for performing the top-up action.

### Proof of Concept

I have implemented a [PoC](https://github.com/sseefried/codearena-backd-2022-04/blob/4d3c3ba7a0139bea01a0bdee9e84a7921572a9fd/backd/tests/top_up_action/sseefried_test_staker_grief.py) in a fork of the contest repo. The attacker's contract can be found [here](https://github.com/sseefried/codearena-backd-2022-04/blob/4d3c3ba7a0139bea01a0bdee9e84a7921572a9fd/backd/contracts/AliceAttacker.sol).

### Recommend Mitigation Steps

To prevent this denial of service attack some way of blacklisting badly behaved Stakers should be added.

Vulnerability details:

## [L-01] The first withdrawal for each vault from the vault reserve has no delay

`_lastWithdrawal[vault]` will always be zero for new vaults, so the check is for `0 + minWithdrawalDelay` which will always be less than `block.timestamp`

```solidity
File: backd/contracts/vault/VaultReserve.sol   #1

102    function canWithdraw(address vault) public view returns (bool) {

```

## [L-02] `AaveHandler` does not extend `BaseHandler`

Unlike `CompoundHandler`, `AaveHandler` does not extend `BaseHandler`, which will cause storage problems in future versions

```solidity

## [L-04] Front-runable initializer

If the initializer is not executed in the same transaction as the constructor, a malicious user can front-run the `initialize()` call, forcing the contract to be redeployed. Most other initializers in this project are protected, but this one appears not to be.

## [L-07] `abi.encodePacked()` should not be used with dynamic types when passing the result to a hash function such as `keccak256()`

Use `abi.encode()` instead which will pad items to 32 bytes, which will [prevent hash collisions](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/abi-spec.html#non-standard-packed-mode) (e.g. `abi.encodePacked(0x123,0x456)` => `0x123456` => `abi.encodePacked(0x1,0x23456)`, but `abi.encode(0x123,0x456)` => `0x0...1230...456`). "Unless there is a compelling reason, `abi.encode` should be preferred". If there is only one argument to `abi.encodePacked()` it can often be cast to `bytes()` or `bytes32()` [instead](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/30912/how-to-compare-strings-in-solidity#answer-82739).

```solidity
File: contracts/actions/topup/handlers/CTokenRegistry.sol   #1

67                 keccak256(abi.encodePacked(ctoken.symbol())) == keccak256(abi.encodePacked("cETH"))
```

## [L-08] `address.call{value:x}()` should be used instead of `payable.transfer()`

The use of `payable.transfer()` is heavily frowned upon because it can lead to the locking of funds. The `transfer()` call requires that the recipient has a `payable` callback, only provides 2300 gas for its operation. This means the following cases can cause the transfer to fail:

*   The contract does not have a `payable` callback
*   The contract's `payable` callback spends more than 2300 gas (which is only enough to emit something)
*   The contract is called through a proxy which itself uses up the 2300 gas

```solidity

## [L-09] Upgradeable contract is missing a `__gap[50]` storage variable to allow for new storage variables in later versions

See [this](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable#storage_gaps) link for a description of this storage variable. While some contracts may not currently be sub-classed, adding the variable now protects against forgetting to add it in the future.

```

## [L-10] Math library unnecessarily overflows during some operations

In the example below, `a + b` may overflow even though the division that comes later would prevent it. This particular case can be prevented by doing [`(a & b) + (a ^ b) / b`](https://github.com/fei-protocol/flywheel-v2/blob/77bfadf388db25cf5917d39cd9c0ad920f404aad/src/token/ERC20MultiVotes.sol#L92-L95). There are other functions with similar issues. See [this](https://github.com/barakman/solidity-math-utils/blob/master/project/contracts/IntegralMath.sol) library for ways of doing math without this sort of issue.

```solidity
File: backd/libraries/ScaledMath.sol   #1

40    function divRoundUp(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
41        return (a + b - 1) / b;
42    }
```

## [N-01] `_prepareDeadline()`, `_setConfig()`, and `_executeDeadline()` should be `private`

These functions have the ability to bypass the timelocks of every setting. No contract besides the `Preparable` contract itself should need to call these functions, and having them available will lead to exploits. The contracts that currently call `_setConfig()` in their constructors should be given a new function `_initConfig()` for this purpose. The `Vault` [calls](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd/blob/c856714a50437cb33240a5964b63687c9876275b/backd/contracts/vault/Vault.sol#L222) some of these functions as well, and should be changed to manually inspect the deadline rather than mucking with the internals, which is error-prone. The mappings should also be made `private`, and there should be public getters to read their values

```solidity

122        uint256 newValue = pendingUInts256[key];
123        _setConfig(key, newValue);

## [N-02] Open TODOs

Code architecture, incentives, and error handling/reporting questions/issues should be resolved before deployment

```solidity
File: contracts/actions/topup/TopUpAction.sol   #1

## [N-03] `payable` function does not reject payments to ERC20 tokens

```solidity
File: backd/contracts/vault/VaultReserve.sol   #1

50        if (token == address(0)) {
51            require(msg.value == amount, Error.INVALID_AMOUNT);
52            _balances[msg.sender][token] += msg.value;
53            return true;
54        }
55        uint256 balance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
```

After the if-statement there should be a `require(0 == msg.value)` to ensure no Ether is being used when updating ERC20 balances. This is non-critical since the function has the `onlyVault` modifier, and presumably vaults would be coded never to deposit Ether to ERC20 tokens
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd/blob/c856714a50437cb33240a5964b63687c9876275b/backd/contracts/vault/VaultReserve.sol#L50-L55>

## [N-04] Adding a `return` statement when the function defines a named return variable, is redundant

```solidity
File: contracts/pool/PoolFactory.sol   #1

```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd/blob/c856714a50437cb33240a5964b63687c9876275b/backd/contracts/pool/PoolFactory.sol#L216>

## [N-05] `public` functions not called by the contract should be declared `external` instead

Contracts [are allowed](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#function-overriding) to override their parents' functions and change the visibility from `external` to `public`.

```solidity
File: contracts/actions/topup/TopUpAction.sol   #1

## [N-06] `constant`s should be defined rather than using magic numbers

See [original submission](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd-findings/issues/182) for instances.

## [N-07] Large multiples of ten should use scientific notation (e.g. `1e6`) rather than decimal literals (e.g. `1000000`), for readability

```solidity

## [N-08] Use a more recent version of solidity

Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.12 to get `string.concat()` to be used instead of `abi.encodePacked(,)`

## [N-09] Constant redefined elsewhere

Consider defining in only one contract so that values cannot become out of sync when only one location is updated. A [cheap way](https://medium.com/coinmonks/gas-cost-of-solidity-library-functions-dbe0cedd4678) to store constants in a single location is to create an `internal constant` in a `library`. If the variable is a local cache of another contract's value, consider making the cache variable internal or private, which will require external users to query the contract with the source of truth, so that callers don't get out of sync.

## [G-01] Caching storage variables in memory to save gas

### PROBLEM

Anytime you are reading from storage more than once, it is cheaper in gas cost to cache the variable in memory: a SLOAD cost 100gas, while MLOAD and MSTORE cost 3 gas.

In particular, in `for` loops, when using the length of a storage array as the condition being checked after each loop, caching the array length in memory can yield significant gas savings if the array length is high.

### MITIGATION

cache these storage variables in memory

## [G-02] Calldata instead of memory for RO function parameters

### PROBLEM

If a reference type function parameter is read-only, it is cheaper in gas to use calldata instead of memory.
Calldata is a non-modifiable, non-persistent area where function arguments are stored, and behaves mostly like memory.

Try to use calldata as a data location because it will avoid copies and also makes sure that the data cannot be modified.

### MITIGATION

Replace `<=` with `<`, and `>=` with `>`. Do not forget to increment/decrement the compared variable

example:

    -require(maxFee >= minFee, Error.INVALID_AMOUNT);
    +require(maxFee > minFee - 1, Error.INVALID_AMOUNT);

When the comparison is with a constant storage variable, you can also do the increment in the storage variable declaration

example:

    -require(maxFee <= _MAX_WITHDRAWAL_FEE, Error.INVALID_AMOUNT)
    +require(maxFee < _MAX_WITHDRAWAL_FEE_PLUS_ONE, Error.INVALID_AMOUNT)

However, when `1` is negligible compared to the variable (with is the case here as the variable is in the order of `10**16`), it is not necessary to increment.

## [G-05] Custom Errors

### PROBLEM

Custom errors from Solidity 0.8.4 are cheaper than revert strings (cheaper deployment cost and runtime cost when the revert condition is met) while providing the same amount of information, as explained [here](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/)

Custom errors are defined using the error statement

## [G-06] Default value initialization

Explicitly initializing it with its default value is an anti-pattern and wastes gas.

## [G-08] Redundant code

### IMPACT

Redundant code should be avoided as it costs unnecessary gas

### PROOF OF CONCEPT

Instances include:

#### Preparable.sol

    Preparable.sol:140:
    address oldValue = currentAddresses[key];
    currentAddresses[key] = value;
    pendingAddresses[key] = address(0);
    deadlines[key] = 0;
    emit ConfigUpdatedAddress(key, oldValue, value);
    return value;

We can update `currentAddresses[key]` after emitting the event to save the gas of the declaration of `oldValue`:

    +emit ConfigUpdatedAddress(key, currentAddresses[key], value);
    pendingAddresses[key] = address(0);
    deadlines[key] = 0;
    currentAddresses[key] = value;
    return value;

### MITIGATION

see Proof of Concept for mitigation steps.

## [G-09] Require instead of &&

### IMPACT

Require statements including conditions with the `&&` operator can be broken down in multiple require statements to save gas.

### PROOF OF CONCEPT

Instances include:

#### TopUpAction.sol

    TopUpAction:360:
    require(
                newSwapperSlippage >= _MIN_SWAPPER_SLIPPAGE &&
                    newSwapperSlippage <= _MAX_SWAPPER_SLIPPAGE,
                Error.INVALID_AMOUNT
            );

#### ConvexStrategyBase.sol

    ConvexStrategyBase:274:
    require(
                token_ != address(_CVX) && token_ != address(underlying) && token_ != address(_CRV),
                Error.INVALID_TOKEN_TO_ADD
            );

#### SwapperRegistry.sol

    SwapperRegistry:35:
    require(
                fromToken != toToken &&
                    fromToken != address(0) &&
                    toToken != address(0) &&
                    newSwapper != address(0),
                Error.INVALID_TOKEN_PAIR
            );

### MITIGATION

Breakdown each condition in a separate `require` statement (though require statements should be [replaced with custom errors](#custom-errors))

    require( newSwapperSlippage >=_MIN_SWAPPER_SLIPPAGE);
    require(newSwapperSlippage <= _MAX_SWAPPER_SLIPPAGE,
                Error.INVALID_AMOUNT)

## [G-10] Tight Variable Packing

### PROBLEM

Solidity contracts have contiguous 32 bytes (256 bits) slots used in storage.
By arranging the variables, it is possible to minimize the number of slots used within a contract's storage and therefore reduce deployment costs.

address type variables are each of 20 bytes size (way less than 32 bytes). However, they here take up a whole 32 bytes slot (they are contiguous).

As bool type variables are of size 1 byte, there's a slot here that can get saved by moving them closer to an address

### PROOF OF CONCEPT

Instances include:

#### VaultStorage.sol

    VaultStorage.sol:11:
    address public pool;
    uint256 public totalDebt;
    bool public strategyActive;

### MITIGATION

Place `strategyActive` after `pool` to save one storage slot

    address public pool;
    +bool public strategyActive;
    uint256 public totalDebt;

## [G-11] Unchecked arithmetic

### PROBLEM

The default "checked" behavior costs more gas when adding/diving/multiplying, because under-the-hood those checks are implemented as a series of opcodes that, prior to performing the actual arithmetic, check for under/overflow and revert if it is detected.

if it can statically be determined there is no possible way for your arithmetic to under/overflow (such as a condition in an if statement), surrounding the arithmetic in an `unchecked` block will save gas

### PROOF OF CONCEPT

Instances include:

#### LiquidityPool.sol

    LiquidityPool.sol:751: underlyingBalance - underlyingToWithdraw; //because of the condition line 745, the underflow check is unnecessary

    Vault.sol:141: uint256 totalUnderlyingAfterWithdraw = totalUnderlying - amount; //because of the condition line 122, the underflow check is unnecessary

    Vault.sol:440: waitingForRemovalAllocated = _waitingForRemovalAllocated - withdrawn; //because of the condition line 437, the underflow check is unnecessary

    Vault.sol:444: uint256 profit = withdrawn - allocated; //because of the condition line 443, the underflow check is unnecessary

    Vault.sol:452: allocated -= withdrawn; //because of the condition line 443, the underflow check is unnecessary

    Vault.sol:591: uint256 profit = allocatedUnderlying - amountAllocated; //because of the condition line 589, the underflow check is unnecessary

    Vault.sol:595: profit -= currentDebt; //because of the condition line 593, the underflow check is unnecessary

    Vault.sol:600: currentDebt -= profit; //because of the condition line 593, the underflow check is unnecessary

    Vault.sol:605: uint256 loss = amountAllocated - allocatedUnderlying; //because of the condition line 603, the underflow check is unnecessary

    Vault.sol:784: uint256 withdrawAmount = allocatedUnderlying - target; //because of the condition line 782, the underflow check is unnecessary

#### StakerVault.sol
