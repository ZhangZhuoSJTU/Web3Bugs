<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/496e1974ee3838be8759e7b4096dbee1b8795593/contracts/Lock.sol#L84-L92> 

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/496e1974ee3838be8759e7b4096dbee1b8795593/contracts/Lock.sol#L98-L105>

### Impact

The `Lock` contract (<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/496e1974ee3838be8759e7b4096dbee1b8795593/contracts/Lock.sol#L10>) allows end-users to interact with bonds.

There are two functions that allow to lock some amount of assets. The first function is `Lock.lock` (<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/496e1974ee3838be8759e7b4096dbee1b8795593/contracts/Lock.sol#L61-L76>) which creates a new bond. The second function is `Lock.extendLock` (<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/496e1974ee3838be8759e7b4096dbee1b8795593/contracts/Lock.sol#L84-L92>). This function extends the lock for some `_period` and / or increases the locked amount by some `_amount`.

The issue is that the `Lock.extendLock` function does not increase the value in `totalLocked[_asset]`. This however is necessary because `totalLocked[_asset]` is reduced when `Lock.release` (<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/496e1974ee3838be8759e7b4096dbee1b8795593/contracts/Lock.sol#L98-L105>) is called.

Therefore only the amount of assets deposited via `Lock.lock` can be released again. The amount of assets deposited using `Lock.extendLock` can never be released again because reducing `totalLocked[_asset]` will cause a revert due to underflow.

So the amount of assets deposited using `Lock.extendLock` is lost.

### Proof of Concept

1.  User A calls `Lock.lock` to lock a certain `_amount` (amount1) of `_asset` for a certain `_period`.
2.  User A calls then `Lock.extendLock` and increases the locked amount of the bond by some amount2
3.  User A waits until the bond has expired
4.  User A calls `Lock.release`. This function calculates `totalLocked[asset] -= lockAmount;`. Which will cause a revert because the value of `totalLocked[asset]` is only amount1

You can add the following test to the `Bonds` test in `Bonds.js`:

```javascript
describe("ReleaseUnderflow", function () {
    it("release can cause underflow", async function () {
        await stabletoken.connect(owner).mintFor(user.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("110"));
        // Lock 100 for 9 days
        await lock.connect(user).lock(StableToken.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("100"), 9);

        await bond.connect(owner).setManager(lock.address);

        await stabletoken.connect(user).approve(lock.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("10"));

        // Lock another 10
        await lock.connect(user).extendLock(1, ethers.utils.parseEther("10"), 0);

        await network.provider.send("evm_increaseTime", [864000]); // Skip 10 days
        await network.provider.send("evm_mine");

        // Try to release 110 after bond has expired -> Underflow
        await lock.connect(user).release(1);
    });
});
```

Run it with `npx hardhat test --grep "release can cause underflow"`.\
You can see that it fails because it causes an underflow.

### Tools Used

VS Code

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add `totalLocked[_asset] += amount` to the `Lock.extendLock` function.

## [[H-02] Riskless trades due to delay check](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/67)
*Submitted by [Bobface](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/67)*

`Trading.limitClose()` uses `_checkDelay()`. This allows for riskless trades, by capturing price rises through increasing the stop-loss, while preventing the underwater position to be closed in case of the price dropping by continuously increasing the delay.

### Detailed description

A malicious trader can exploit the `Trading` contract to achieve riskless trades. In the worst-case scenario, the trader can always close the trade break-even, while in a good scenario the trader captures all upside price movement.

The exploit is based on three principles:

1.  The stop-loss of a position can be updated without any delay checks, due to `_checkDelay()` not being called in `updateTpSl()`
2.  Positions can only be closed by MEV bots or other third parties after the block delay has been passed due to `limitClose` calling `_checkDelay()`
3.  The block delay can be continuously renewed for a negligible cost

**Based on these three principles, the following method can be used to perform riskless trades:**
Assuming a current market price of 1,000 DAI, begin by opening a long limit order through `initiateLimitOrder()` at the current market price of 1,000 DAI and stop-loss at the exact market price of 1,000 DAI. Then immediately execute the limit order through `executeLimitOrder`.

After the block delay has passed, MEV bots or other third parties interested in receiving a percentage reward for closing the order would call `limitClose`. However, we can prevent them from doing so by continuously calling `addToPosition` with 1 wei when the block delay comes close to running out *\[1]*, which will renew the delay and thus stops `limitClose` from being called.

While the trader keeps renewing the delay to stop his position from being closed, he watches the price development:

*   If the price goes **down**, the trader will not make any loss, since he still has his original stop-loss set. He just has to make sure that the price does not drop too far to be liquidated through `liquidatePosition()`. If the price comes close to the liquidation zone, he stops renewing the delay and closes the position break-even for the initial stop-loss price even though the price is down significantly further. He can also choose to do that at any other point in time if he decides the price is unlikely to move upward again.
*   If the price goes **up**, the trader calls `updateTpSl()` to lock in the increased price. For example, if the price moves from 1,000 DAI to 2,000 DAI, he calls `updateTpSl()` with 2,000 DAI as stop-loss. Even if the price drops below 2,000 DAI again, the stop-loss is stored. This function can be called while the delay is still in place because there is no call to `_checkDelay()`.

The trader keeps calling `updateTpSl()` when the price reaches a new high since he opened the position initially to capture all upside movement. When he decides that the price has moved high enough, he finally lets the delay run out and calls `limitClose()` to close the order at the peak stop-loss.

*Notes*
*\[1]*: Tigris Trade also plans to use L2s such as Arbitrum where there is one block per transaction. This could bring up the false impression that the trader would have to make lots of calls to `addToPosition` after every few transactions on the chain. However, `block.number`, which is used by the contract, actually returns the L1 block number and not the L2 block number.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The core issue is that the position cannot be closed even if it is below the stop-loss due to constantly renewing the delay. The delay checking in `limitClose()` should be modified to also consider whether the position is below the stop-loss.

### Proof of Concept

Insert the following code as test into `test/07.Trading.js` and run it with `npx hardhat test test/07.Trading.js`:

```javascript
describe("PoC", function () {
    it.only("PoC", async function () {
      // Setup token balances and approvals
      const mockDAI = await ethers.getContractAt("MockERC20", MockDAI.address)
      await mockDAI.connect(owner).transfer(user.address, parseEther("10000"))
      await mockDAI.connect(owner).transfer(stablevault.address, parseEther("100000"))
      await mockDAI.connect(user).approve(trading.address, parseEther("10000"))
      const daiAtBeginning = await mockDAI.balanceOf(user.address)
      const permitData = [
        "0",

        "0",

        "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
        false

          This won't change anything about our position, but it will reset the delay timer,
          stopping bots from calling `limitClose()`. 

          This means that if the price drops, we can keep our position open with the higher stop loss, avoiding any losses.
          And if the price rises, we can push the stop loss higher to keep profits.

          The loop runs five times just to demonstrate. In reality, this could be done as long as needed.

## [[H-03] Certain fee configuration enables vaults to be drained](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/86)
*Submitted by [Bobface](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/86)*

An overflow in `TradingLibrary.pnl()` enables all funds from the vault contracts to be drained given a certain fee configuration is present.

### Detailed exploit process description

When opening a position, any value can be passed as take-profit price. This value is later used in the PNL calculation in an `unchecked` block. Setting this value specifically to attack the vault leads to the `Trading` contract minting a huge (in the example below `10^36`) Tigris tokens, which can then be given to the vault to withdraw assets.

The exploiter starts by setting himself as referrer, in order to later receive the referrer fees.

The next step is to open a short position at the current market price by calling `initiateLimitOrder()`. Here, the malicious value which will later bring the arithmetic to overflow is passed in as take-profit price. For the example below, the value has been calculated by hand to be `115792089237316195423570985008687907854269984665640564039467` for this specific market price, leverage and margin.

The order is then immediately executed through `executeLimitOrder()`.

The final step is to close the order through `limitClose()`, which will then mint over `10^36` Tigris tokens to the attacker.

### Detailed bug description

The bug takes place in `TradingLibrary.pnl()`, line 46. The function is called during the process of closing the order to calculate the payout and position size. The malicious take-profit is passed as `_currentPrice` and the order's original opening price is passed as `_price`. The take-profit has been specifically calculated so that `1e18 * _currentPrice / _price - 1e18` results in `0`, meaning `_payout = _margin` (`accInterest` is negligible for this PoC).
Line 48 then calculates the position size. Margin and leverage have been chosen so that `_initPositionSize * _currentPrice` does not overflow, resulting in a huge `_positionSize` which is returned from the function.

Later, `Trading._handleCloseFees()` is called, under the condition that `_payout > 0`, which is why the overflow had to be calculated so precisely, as to not subtract from the `_payout` but still create a large `_positionSize`. `_positionSize` is passed in to this function, and it is used to calculate DAO and referral fees. Line 805 is what requires the specific fee configuration to be present, as otherwise this line would revert. The fees have to be `daoFees = 2*referralFees` -- not exactly, but close to this relationship. Then line 792 will set the DAO fees close to zero, while the huge `referralFees` are directly minted and not included in the calculation in line 805.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The core issue is that the arithmetic in `TradingLibrary.pnl()` overflows. I recommend removing the `unchecked` block.

### Proof of Concept

Insert the following code as test into `test/07.Trading.js` and run it with `npx hardhat test test/07.Trading.js`:

## [[H-04] Bypass the maximum PnL check to take extra profit](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/111)
*Submitted by [KingNFT](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/111)*

To protect the fund of vault, the protocol has a security mechanism which limits:

    Maximum PnL is +500%. 

source: <https://docs.tigris.trade/protocol/trading-and-fees#limitations>

But the implementation is missing to check this limitation while `addToPosition()`, an attacker can exploit it to get more profit than expected.

### Proof of Concept

The following test case shows both normal case and the exploit scenario.

In the normal case,  a 990 USD margin, gets back a 500% of 4950 USD payout, and the profit is 3960 USD.

In the exploit case, the attack will get an extra 2600+ USD profit than the normal case.

  });
});


```

The test result

     Design Specification: Maximum PnL is +500%
        Bypass the maximum PnL check to take extra profit
          √ All profit is $9900, close the order normally, only get $3960 profit
          √ All profit is $9900, bypass the PnL check to take extra $2600 profit

### Tools Used

VS Code

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add a check for `addToPosition()` function, revert if PnL >= 500%, enforce users to close the order to take a limited profit.

## [[H-05] Malicious user can steal all assets in BondNFT](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/170)
*Submitted by [hihen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/170), also found by [hansfriese](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/503), [unforgiven](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/423), [\_\_141345\_\_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/398), [rvierdiiev](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/182), and [HollaDieWaldfee](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/68)*

Malicious user can drain all assets in BondNFT, and other users will lose their rewards.

### Proof of Concept

When calling [BondNFT.claim()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/588c84b7bb354d20cbca6034544c4faa46e6a80e/contracts/BondNFT.sol#L168-L187) for an expired bond, it will recalculate `accRewardsPerShare`. This is because the reward after the `expireEpoch` does not belong to that expired bond and needs to be redistributed to all other bonds.

```solidity
  if (bond.expired) {
      uint _pendingDelta = (bond.shares * accRewardsPerShare[bond.asset][epoch[bond.asset]] / 1e18 - bondPaid[_id][bond.asset]) - (bond.shares * accRewardsPerShare[bond.asset][bond.expireEpoch-1] / 1e18 - bondPaid[_id][bond.asset]);
      if (totalShares[bond.asset] > 0) {
          accRewardsPerShare[bond.asset][epoch[bond.asset]] += _pendingDelta*1e18/totalShares[bond.asset];
      }
  }
```

In the current implementation of [BondNFT.claim()](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/588c84b7bb354d20cbca6034544c4faa46e6a80e/contracts/BondNFT.sol#L168-L187), it can be called repeatedly as long as the expired bond is not released.

According to the formula in the above code, we can find that although each subsequent `claim()` of the expired bond will transfer 0 reward, the `accRewardsPerShare` will be updated cumulatively.
Thus, the pending rewards of all other users will increase every time the expired bond is `claim()`ed.

A malicious user can exploit this vulnerability to steal all assets in BondNFT contract:

1.  Create two bonds (B1, B2) with different `expireEpoch`
2.  At some time after B1 has expired (B2 has not), keep calling [`Lock.claim(B1)`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/588c84b7bb354d20cbca6034544c4faa46e6a80e/contracts/Lock.sol#L34) to increase rewards of B2 continuously, until the pending rewards of B2 approaches the total amount of asset in the contract.
3.  Call [`Lock.claim(B2)`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/588c84b7bb354d20cbca6034544c4faa46e6a80e/contracts/Lock.sol#L34) to claim all pending rewards of B2.

## [[H-06] Incorrect calculation of new price while adding position](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/236)
*Submitted by [KingNFT](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/236)*

The formula used for calculating `_newPrice` in `addToPosition()` function of Trading.sol is not correct, users will lose part of their funds/profit while using this function.

The wrong formula

    uint _newPrice = _trade.price*_trade.margin/_newMargin + _price*_addMargin/_newMargin;

The correct formula is

    uint _newPrice = _trade.price * _price * _newMargin /  (_trade.margin * _price + _addMargin * _trade.price);

Why this works?

Given

    P1 = _trade.price
    P2 = _price
    P = _newPrice
    M1 = _trade.margin
    M2 = _addMargin
    M =  M1 + M2 = _newMargin
    L = _trade.leverage
    U1 = M1 * L  = old position in USD
    U2 = M2 * L = new position in USD
    U = U1 + U2 = total position in USD
    E1 = U1 / P1 = old position of base asset, such as ETH, of the pair
    E2 = U2 / P2 = new position of base asset of the pair
    E = E1 + E2 = total position of base asset of the pair

Then

    P = U / E
      = (U1 + U2) / (E1 + E2)
      = (M1 * L + M2 * L) / (U1 / P1 + U2 / P2)
      = P1 * P2 * (M1 * L + M2 * L) / (U1 * P2 + U2 * P1)
      = P1 * P2 * (M1 + M2) * L / (M1 * L * P2 + M2 * L * P1)
      = P1 * P2 * (M1 + M2) * L / [(M1 * P2 + M2 * P1) * L]
      = P1 * P2 * M / (M1 * P2 + M2 * P1)

proven.

### Proof of Concept

The following test case shows two examples that users lose some funds due to adding a new position whenever their existing position is in profit or loss state.

## [[H-07] reentrancy attack during `mint()` function in Position contract which can lead to removing of the other user's limit orders or stealing contract funds because initId is set low value](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/400)
*Submitted by [unforgiven](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/400), also found by [wait](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/539), [rotcivegaf](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/489), [0xsomeone](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/459), [hihen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/451), [KingNFT](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/357), [mookimgo](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/288), [debo](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/186), and [stealthyz](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/90)*

Function `Position.mint()` has been used in `initiateLimitOrder()` and `initiateMarketOrder()` and it doesn't follow check-effect-interaction pattern and code updates the values of `_limitOrders`, `initId`, `_openPositions` and `position _tokenIds` variables after making external call by using `safeMint()`. This would give the attacker opportunity to reenter the Trading contract logics and perform malicious actions while the contract storage state is wrong. The only limitation of the attacker is that he needs to bypass `_checkDelay()` checks. Attacker can perform this action:

1.  Call `initiateLimitOrder()` and create limit order with id equal to ID1 reenter (while `_limitOrders` for ID1 is not yet settled) with `cancelLimitOrder(ID1)` (no `checkDelay()` check) and remove other users limit orders because code would try to remove `_limitOrderIndexes[_asset][ID1]` position but the value is 0 and code would remove limit order in the index 0 which belongs to another user in the `Position.burn()` code.
2.  Call `initiateMarketOrder()` and create a position with ID1 and while `initId[ID1]` has not yet settled reenter the Trading with `addToPosition(ID1)` function (bypass `checkDelay()` because both action is opening) and increase the position size which would set `initId[ID1]` according to new position values but then when code execution returns to rest of `mint()` logic `initId[ID1]` would set by initial values of the positions which is very lower than what it should be and `initId[ID1]` has been used for calculating `accuredInterest` of the position which is calculated for profit and loss of position and contract would calculate more profit for position and would pay attacker more profit from contract balances.

### Proof of Concept

This is `mint()` code in Position contract:

        function mint(
            MintTrade memory _mintTrade
        ) external onlyMinter {
            uint newTokenID = _tokenIds.current();

            Trade storage newTrade = _trades[newTokenID];
            newTrade.margin = _mintTrade.margin;
            newTrade.leverage = _mintTrade.leverage;
            newTrade.asset = _mintTrade.asset;
            newTrade.direction = _mintTrade.direction;
            newTrade.price = _mintTrade.price;
            newTrade.tpPrice = _mintTrade.tp;
            newTrade.slPrice = _mintTrade.sl;
            newTrade.orderType = _mintTrade.orderType;
            newTrade.id = newTokenID;
            newTrade.tigAsset = _mintTrade.tigAsset;

            _safeMint(_mintTrade.account, newTokenID);   // make external call because of safeMint() usage
            if (_mintTrade.orderType > 0) { // update the values of some storage functions
                _limitOrders[_mintTrade.asset].push(newTokenID);
                _limitOrderIndexes[_mintTrade.asset][newTokenID] = _limitOrders[_mintTrade.asset].length-1;
            } else {
                initId[newTokenID] = accInterestPerOi[_mintTrade.asset][_mintTrade.tigAsset][_mintTrade.direction]*int256(_mintTrade.margin*_mintTrade.leverage/1e18)/1e18;
                _openPositions.push(newTokenID);
                _openPositionsIndexes[newTokenID] = _openPositions.length-1;

                _assetOpenPositions[_mintTrade.asset].push(newTokenID);
                _assetOpenPositionsIndexes[_mintTrade.asset][newTokenID] = _assetOpenPositions[_mintTrade.asset].length-1;
            }
            _tokenIds.increment();
        }

As you can see by calling `_safeMint()`, code would make external call to `onERC721Received()` function of the account address and the code sets the values for `_limitOrders[]`, `_limitOrderIndexes[]`, `initId[]`, `_openPositions[]`, `_openPositionsIndexes[]`, `_assetOpenPositions[]`, `_assetOpenPositionsIndexes[]` and `_tokenIds`. So code doesn't follow check-effect-interaction pattern and it's possible to perform reentrancy attack.

There could be multiple scenarios that the attacker can perform the attack and do some damage. Two of them are:

**Scenario #1 where attacker removes other users limit orders and create broken storage state**

1.  Attacker contract would call `initiateLimitOrder()` and code would create the limit order and mint it in the `Position._safeMint()` with ID1.
2.  Then code would call attacker address in `_safeMint()` function because of the `onERC721Received()` call check.
3.  Variables `_limitOrders[]`, `_limitOrderIndexes[ID1]` are not yet updated for ID1 and `_limitOrderIndexes[ID1]` is 0x0 and ID1 is not in `_limitOrder[]` list.
4.  Attacker contract would reenter the Trading contract by calling `cancelLimitOrder(ID1)`.
5.  `cancelLimitOrder()` checks would pass and would try to call `Position.burn(ID1)`.
6.  `burn()` function would try to remove ID1 from `_limitOrders[]` list but because `_limitOrderIndexes[ID1]` is 0, the code would remove the 0 index limit order which belongs to another user.
7.  Execution would return to `Position.mint()` logic and code would add burned id token to `_limitOrder[]` list.

So there are two impacts here.  First, other users limit orders get removed.  The second is that contract storage had a bad state and burned tokens get stock in the list.

**Scenario #2 where attacker steal contract/users funds by wrong profit calculation**

1.  Attacker's contract would call `initiateMarketOrder(lowMargin)` to create position with ID1 while the margin is low.
2.  Code would mint position token for attacker and in `_safeMint()` would make external call and call `onERC721Received()` function of attacker address.
3.  The value of `initId[ID1]` is not yet set for ID1.
4.  Attacker contract would call `addToPosition(ID1, bigMargin)` to increase the margin of the position the `_checkDelay()` check would pass because both actions are opening position.
5.  Code would increase the margin of the position and set the value of the `initId[ID1]` by calling `position.addToPosition()` and the value would be based on the `newMargin`.
6.  The execution flow would receive the rest of `Position.mint()` function and code would set `initId[ID1]` based on old margin value.
7.  Then the value of `initId[ID1]` for attacker position would be very low, which would cause `accInterest` to be higher than it's supposed to be for position(in `Position.trades()` function calculations ) and would cause `_payout` value to be very high (in `pnl()` function's calculations) and when attacker close position ID1 attacker would receive a lot more profit from it.

So attacker created a position with a lot of profit by reentering the logics and manipulating calculation of the profits for the position.

There can be other scenarios possible to perform and damage the protocol or users because there is no reentrancy protection mechanism and attacker only need to bypass validity checks of functions.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/StableVault.sol#L60-L72>

### Impact

The `StableVault` contract attempts to group all types of stablecoins under a single token which can be minted for any of the stablecoins supported by the system as well as burned for any of them.

This is at minimum a medium-severity vulnerability as the balance sheet of the `StableVault` will consist of multiple assets which do not have a one-to-one exchange ratio between them as can be observed by trading pools such as [Curve](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/3pool/deposit) as well as the [Chainlink oracle reported prices themselves](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/usdc-usd).

Given that the contract exposes a 0% slippage 1-to-1 exchange between assets that in reality have varying prices, the balance sheet of the contract can be arbitraged (especially by flash-loans) to swap an undesirable asset (i.e. USDC which at the time of submission was valued at `0.99994853` USD) for a more desirable asset (i.e. USDT which at the time of submission was valued at `1.00000000` USD) acquiring an arbitrage in the price by selling the traded asset.

### Proof of Concept

To illustrate the issue, simply view the exchange output you would get for swapping your USDC to USDT in a stablecoin pool (i.e. CurveFi) and then proceed to [invoke `deposit`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/StableVault.sol#L39-L51) with your USDC asset and retrieve your [incorrectly calculated `USDT` equivalent via `withdraw`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/StableVault.sol#L60-L72).

The arbitrage can be observed by assessing the difference in the trade outputs and can be capitalized by selling our newly acquired `USDT` for `USDC` on the stablecoin pair we assessed earlier, ultimately ending up with a greater amount of `USDC` than we started with. This type of attack can be extrapolated by utilizing a flash-loan rather than our personal funds.

### Tools Used

[Chainlink oracle resources](https://data.chain.link/popular)

[Curve Finance pools](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools)

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

We advise the `StableVault` to utilize Chainlink oracles for evaluating the inflow of assets instead, ensuring that all inflows and outflows of stablecoins are fairly evaluated based on their "neutral" USD price rather than their subjective on-chain price or equality assumption.

## [[H-09] Users can bypass the `maxWinPercent` limit using a partially closing](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/507)
*Submitted by [hansfriese](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/507), also found by [0x52](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/487), [0xA5DF](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/339), and [bin2chen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/332)*

Users can bypass the `maxWinPercent` limit using a partial closing.

As a result, users can receive more funds than their upper limit from the protocol.

### Proof of Concept

As we can see from the [documentation](https://docs.tigris.trade/protocol/trading-and-fees#limitations), there is limitation of a maximum PnL.

    Maximum PnL is +500%. The trade won't be closed unless the user sets a Take Profit order or closes the position manually.

And this logic was implemented like below in `_closePosition()`.

```solidity
File: 2022-12-tigris\contracts\Trading.sol
624:                 _toMint = _handleCloseFees(_trade.asset, uint256(_payout)*_percent/DIVISION_CONSTANT, _trade.tigAsset, _positionSize*_percent/DIVISION_CONSTANT, _trade.trader, _isBot);
625:                 if (maxWinPercent > 0 && _toMint > _trade.margin*maxWinPercent/DIVISION_CONSTANT) { //@audit bypass limit
626:                     _toMint = _trade.margin*maxWinPercent/DIVISION_CONSTANT;
627:                 }
```

But it checks the `maxWinPercent` between the partial payout and full margin so the below scenario is possible.

1.  Alice opened an order of margin = 100 and PnL = 1000 after taking closing fees.
2.  If `maxWinPercent` = 500%, Alice should receive 500 at most.
3.  But Alice closed 50% of the position and she got 500 for a 50% margin because it checks `maxWinPercent` with `_toMint = 500` and `_trade.margin = 100`
4.  After she closed 50% of the position, the remaining margin = 50 and PnL = 500 so she can continue step 3 again and again.
5.  As a result, she can withdraw almost 100% of the initial PnL(1000) even though she should receive at most 500.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

We should check the `maxWinPercent` between the partial payout and partial margin like below.

```solidity
    _toMint = _handleCloseFees(_trade.asset, uint256(_payout)*_percent/DIVISION_CONSTANT, _trade.tigAsset, _positionSize*_percent/DIVISION_CONSTANT, _trade.trader, _isBot);

    uint256 partialMarginToClose = _trade.margin * _percent / DIVISION_CONSTANT; //+++++++++++++++++++++++
    if (maxWinPercent > 0 && _toMint > partialMarginToClose*maxWinPercent/DIVISION_CONSTANT) { 
        _toMint = partialMarginToClose*maxWinPercent/DIVISION_CONSTANT;
    }
```

## [[H-10] User can abuse tight stop losses and high leverage to make risk free trades](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/622)
*Submitted by [0x52](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/622), also found by [hansfriese](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/515) and [noot](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/48)*

User can abuse how stop losses are priced to open high leverage trades with huge upside and very little downside.

### Proof of Concept

    function limitClose(
        uint _id,
        bool _tp,
        PriceData calldata _priceData,
        bytes calldata _signature
    )
        external
    {
        _checkDelay(_id, false);
        (uint _limitPrice, address _tigAsset) = tradingExtension._limitClose(_id, _tp, _priceData, _signature);
        _closePosition(_id, DIVISION_CONSTANT, _limitPrice, address(0), _tigAsset, true);
    }

    function _limitClose(
        uint _id,
        bool _tp,
        PriceData calldata _priceData,
        bytes calldata _signature
    ) external view returns(uint _limitPrice, address _tigAsset) {
        _checkGas();

        IPosition.Trade memory _trade = position.trades(_id);
        _tigAsset = _trade.tigAsset;
        getVerifiedPrice(_trade.asset, _priceData, _signature, 0);
        uint256 _price = _priceData.price;
        if (_trade.orderType != 0) revert("4"); //IsLimit
        if (_tp) {
            if (_trade.tpPrice == 0) revert("7"); //LimitNotSet
            if (_trade.direction) {
                if (_trade.tpPrice > _price) revert("6"); //LimitNotMet
            } else {
                if (_trade.tpPrice < _price) revert("6"); //LimitNotMet
            }
            _limitPrice = _trade.tpPrice;
        } else {
            if (_trade.slPrice == 0) revert("7"); //LimitNotSet
            if (_trade.direction) {
                if (_trade.slPrice < _price) revert("6"); //LimitNotMet
            } else {
                if (_trade.slPrice > _price) revert("6"); //LimitNotMet
            }
            //@audit stop loss is closed at user specified price NOT market price
            _limitPrice = _trade.slPrice;
        }
    }

When closing a position with a stop loss the user is closed at their SL price rather than the current price of the asset. A user could abuse this in directional markets with high leverage to make nearly risk free trades. A user could open a long with a stop loss that in $0.01 below the current price. If the price tanks immediately on the next update then they will be closed out at their entrance price, only out the fees to open and close their position. If the price goes up then they can make a large gain.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Take profit and stop loss trades should be executed at the current price rather than the price specified by the user:

             if (_trade.tpPrice == 0) revert("7"); //LimitNotSet
            if (_trade.direction) {
                if (_trade.tpPrice > _price) revert("6"); //LimitNotMet
            } else {
                if (_trade.tpPrice < _price) revert("6"); //LimitNotMet
            }
    -       _limitPrice = _trade.tpPrice;
    +       _limitPrice = _price;
        } else {
            if (_trade.slPrice == 0) revert("7"); //LimitNotSet
            if (_trade.direction) {
                if (_trade.slPrice < _price) revert("6"); //LimitNotMet
            } else {
                if (_trade.slPrice > _price) revert("6"); //LimitNotMet
            }
    -       _limitPrice = _trade.slPrice;
    +       _limitPrice = _price;

## [[H-11] Not enough margin pulled or burned from user when adding to a position](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/659)
*Submitted by [minhtrng](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/659), also found by [Aymen0909](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/644), [hansfriese](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/505), [0Kage](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/488), [Jeiwan](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/433), [bin2chen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/325), [KingNFT](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/209), [HollaDieWaldfee](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/194), and [rvierdiiev](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/130)*

When adding to a position, the amount of margin pulled from the user is not as much as it should be, which leaks value from the protocol, lowering the collateralization ratio of `tigAsset`.

### Proof of Concept

In `Trading.addToPosition` the `_handleDeposit` function is called like this:

```js
_handleDeposit(
    _trade.tigAsset,
    _marginAsset,
    _addMargin - _fee,
    _stableVault,
    _permitData,
    _trader
);
```

The third parameter with the value of `_addMargin - _fee` is the amount pulled (or burned in the case of using `tigAsset`) from the user. The `_fee` value is calculated as part of the position size like this:

```js
uint _fee = _handleOpenFees(_trade.asset, _addMargin*_trade.leverage/1e18, _trader, _trade.tigAsset, false);
```

The `_handleOpenFees` function mints `_tigAsset` to the referrer, to the `msg.sender` (if called by a function meant to be executed by bots) and to the protocol itself. Those minted tokens are supposed to be part of the `_addMargin` value paid by the user. Hence using `_addMargin - _fee` as the third parameter to `_handleDeposit` is going to pull or burn less margin than what was accounted for.

An example for correct usage can be seen in `initiateMarketOrder`:

```js
uint256 _marginAfterFees = _tradeInfo.margin - _handleOpenFees(_tradeInfo.asset, _tradeInfo.margin*_tradeInfo.leverage/1e18, _trader, _tigAsset, false);
uint256 _positionSize = _marginAfterFees * _tradeInfo.leverage / 1e18;
_handleDeposit(_tigAsset, _tradeInfo.marginAsset, _tradeInfo.margin, _tradeInfo.stableVault, _permitData, _trader);
```

Here the third parameter to `_handleDeposit` is not `_marginAfterFees` but `_tradeInfo.margin` which is what the user has input on and is supposed to pay.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

In `Trading.addToPosition` call the `_handleDeposit` function without subtracting the `_fee` value:

```js
_handleDeposit(
    _trade.tigAsset,
    _marginAsset,
    _addMargin,
    _stableVault,
    _permitData,
    _trader
);
```

# Medium Risk Findings (24)
## [[M-01] Lock.sol: claimGovFees function can cause assets to be stuck in the Lock contract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/73)
*Submitted by [HollaDieWaldfee](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/73), also found by [\_\_141345\_\_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/404) and [0xdeadbeef0x](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/99)*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/496e1974ee3838be8759e7b4096dbee1b8795593/contracts/Lock.sol#L110> 

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/496e1974ee3838be8759e7b4096dbee1b8795593/contracts/BondNFT.sol#L215>

### Impact

When calling [`Lock.claimGovFees`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/496e1974ee3838be8759e7b4096dbee1b8795593/contracts/Lock.sol#L110), assets that are set to be not allowed or assets that don't have any shares yet in the `BondNFT` contract will cause a silent failure in [`BondNFT.distribute`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/496e1974ee3838be8759e7b4096dbee1b8795593/contracts/BondNFT.sol#L215).

The funds from the `GovNFT` contract will get transferred into the `Lock` contract and then will be stuck there. They cannot be recovered.

### Proof of Concept

1.  An asset is added to the `BondNFT` contract by calling [`BondNFT.addAsset`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/496e1974ee3838be8759e7b4096dbee1b8795593/contracts/BondNFT.sol#L349)
2.  There are no bonds yet for this asset so the amount of shares for the asset is zero
3.  [`Lock.claimGovFees`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/496e1974ee3838be8759e7b4096dbee1b8795593/contracts/Lock.sol#L110) is called
4.  Funds are transferred from the `GovNFT` contract to the [`Lock` contract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/496e1974ee3838be8759e7b4096dbee1b8795593/contracts/Lock.sol#L115)
5.  The call to `BondNFT.distribute` now fails quietly without reverting the transaction:
    ```solidity
     if (totalShares[_tigAsset] == 0 || !allowedAsset[_tigAsset]) return;
    ```
6.  The funds are now stuck in the `Lock` contract. They cannot be recovered.

### Tools Used

VS Code

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

A naive solution would be to use `revert` instead of `return` in `BondNFT.distribute` such that funds are either transferred from `GovNFT` to `Lock` and then to `BondNFT` or not at all.

```solidity
     ) external {
-        if (totalShares[_tigAsset] == 0 || !allowedAsset[_tigAsset]) return;
+        if (totalShares[_tigAsset] == 0 || !allowedAsset[_tigAsset]) revert;
         IERC20(_tigAsset).transferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), _amount);
         unchecked {
             uint aEpoch = block.timestamp / DAY;
```

This however is an incomplete fix because if there is a single "bad" asset, rewards for the other assets cannot be distributed either.

Moreover functions like `Lock.lock` and `Lock.release` rely on `Lock.claimGovFees` to not revert.

So you might allow the owner to rescue stuck tokens from the `Lock` contract. Of course only allow rescuing the balance of the `Lock` contract minus the `totalLocked` of the asset in the `Lock` contract such that the locked amount cannot be rescued.

Some tokens (like USDT) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value. They must first be approved by zero and then the actual allowance must be approved.

### Proof of Concept

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Lock.sol#L117>

```solidity
    function claimGovFees() public {
        address[] memory assets = bondNFT.getAssets();

        for (uint i=0; i < assets.length; i++) {
            uint balanceBefore = IERC20(assets[i]).balanceOf(address(this));
            IGovNFT(govNFT).claim(assets[i]);
            uint balanceAfter = IERC20(assets[i]).balanceOf(address(this));
            IERC20(assets[i]).approve(address(bondNFT), type(uint256).max);// @audit this could fail always with some tokens, 
            bondNFT.distribute(assets[i], balanceAfter - balanceBefore);
        }
    }
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add an `approve(0)` before approving;

        function claimGovFees() public {
            address[] memory assets = bondNFT.getAssets();

            for (uint i=0; i < assets.length; i++) {
                uint balanceBefore = IERC20(assets[i]).balanceOf(address(this));
                IGovNFT(govNFT).claim(assets[i]);
                uint balanceAfter = IERC20(assets[i]).balanceOf(address(this));
                IERC20(assets[i]).approve(address(bondNFT), 0);
                IERC20(assets[i]).approve(address(bondNFT), type(uint256).max);
                bondNFT.distribute(assets[i], balanceAfter - balanceBefore);
            }
      }

## [[M-03] Bypass the delay security check to win risk free funds](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/108)

The current implementation uses `_checkDelay()` function to prevent profitable opening and closing in the same tx with two different prices in the "valid signature pool". But the protection is not enough, an attacker can long with low price and short with high price at the same tx but two orders to lock profit and take risk free funds.

How to run

Put the test case to a new BypassDelayCheck.js file of test directory, and run:

    npx hardhat test

And the test result will be:

      Bypass delay check to earn risk free profit
        Simulate long with low price and short with high price at the same tx to lock profit
          √ Exit at any price to take profit
          √ Exit with another price pair to double profit

### Tools Used

VS Code, Hardhat

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Cache recent lowest and highest prices, open long order with the highest price and short order with the lowest price.

## [[M-04] Approved operators of Position token can't call Trading.initiateCloseOrder](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/124)
*Submitted by [rvierdiiev](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/124), also found by [\_\_141345\_\_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/401) and [UniversalCrypto](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/280)*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Trading.sol#L235> 

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Trading.sol#L847-L849>

### Impact

Approved operators of owner of Position token can't call several function in Trading.

### Proof of Concept

Functions that accept Position token in Trading are checking that the caller is owner of token using `\_checkOwner` function. 

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Trading.sol#L847-L849>

```soldiity
    function _checkOwner(uint _id, address _trader) internal view {
        if (position.ownerOf(_id) != _trader) revert("2"); //NotPositionOwner   
    }
```

As you can see this function doesn't allow approved operators of token's owner to pass the check. As a resul, functions are not possible to call for them on behalf of owner.

For example [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Trading.sol#L235), there is a check that doesn't allow to call initiateCloseOrder function.

### Tools Used

VS Code

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Allow operators of token's owner to call functions on behalf of owner.

## [[M-05] Failure in `endpoint` can cause minting more than one NFT with the same token id in different chains](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/150)
*Submitted by [HE1M](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/150)*

In the contract `GovNFT`, it is possible to bridge the governance NFT to other chains. It is also stated in the document that:

> NFT holders only earn the profits generated by the platform on the chain that the NFT is on.

It is assumed that there is only one unique NFT per token id. But there is a scenario that can lead to more than one NFT with the same token id on different chains.

### Proof of Concept

*   Suppose Bob (honest user who owns an NFT with token id X on chain B) plans to bridge this NFT from chain B to chain A. So, Bob calls the function `crossChain` to bridge the NFT from chain B to chain A. Thus, his NFT will be burnt on chain B, and it is supposed to be minted on chain A.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/588c84b7bb354d20cbca6034544c4faa46e6a80e/contracts/GovNFT.sol#L124>

*   The `endpoint` is responsible for completing  the bridging task on chain A.
*   Suppose the `endpoint` calls the function `lzReceive` with low gas on chain A, so that the transaction will be not successful.

<!---->

    function lzReceive(
            uint16 _srcChainId,
            bytes memory _srcAddress,
            uint64 _nonce,
            bytes memory _payload
        ) external override {
            require(_msgSender() == address(endpoint), "!Endpoint");
            (bool success, bytes memory reason) = address(this).excessivelySafeCall(gasleft()*4/5, 150, abi.encodeWithSelector(this.nonblockingLzReceive.selector, _srcChainId, _srcAddress, _nonce, _payload));
            // try-catch all errors/exceptions
            if (!success) {
                failedMessages[_srcChainId][_srcAddress][_nonce] = keccak256(_payload);
                emit MessageFailed(_srcChainId, _srcAddress, _nonce, _payload, reason);
            }
        }

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/588c84b7bb354d20cbca6034544c4faa46e6a80e/contracts/GovNFT.sol#L168>

*   Since the transaction was not successful, the message will be added as a failed message.

<!---->

    failedMessages[chainB][Bob's address][_nonce] = keccak256(_payload);

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/588c84b7bb354d20cbca6034544c4faa46e6a80e/contracts/GovNFT.sol#L178>

*   Then, due to network lag (or any server issue, or any failure in `endpoint`), the `endpoint` assumes that the transaction is not sent, and it again calls this function with enough gas, so, the NFT with token id X will be minted to Bob's address on chain A. The flow is as follows:

`lzReceive` ==> `nonblockingLzReceive` ==> `_nonblockingLzReceive` ==> `_bridgeMint`

*   Now Bob has the NFT on chain A. Moreover, he has a failed message on chain A.
*   Then Bob calls the function `crossChain` to bridge that NFT from chain A to chain B. So, this NFT will be burnt on chain A, and minted to Bob's address on chain B.
*   Now, Bob has the NFT with token id X on chain B. Moreover, he has a failed message on chain A.
*   He calls the function `retryMessage` to retry the failed message on chain A.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/588c84b7bb354d20cbca6034544c4faa46e6a80e/contracts/GovNFT.sol#L206>

*   By doing so the NFT with token id X will be minted to Bob on chain A. The flow is as follows:

`retryMessage` ==> `_nonblockingLzReceive` ==> `_bridgeMint`

*   Now Bob has the NFT with token id X on both chain A and chain B. This is the vulnerability.
*   Now he can, for example, sell the NFT on chain B while he is earning the profits generated by the platform on the chain A that the NFT is on.
*   Please note that Bob can not call the function `retryMessage` while he owns the NFT on chain A. Because during minting the NFT, it checks whether the token id exists or not. That is why Bob first bridges the NFT to another chain, and then retries the failed message.

***The vulnerability is that when the message is failed, it is not considered as consumed, so in case of a failure in `endpoint` it is possible to have failed messages and be able to mint it at the same time.***

Please note that if this scenario happens again, more NFTs with the same token id X will be minted to Bob on different chains.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

It is recommended to track the consumed messages, and add a consumed flag whenever the function `lzReceive` is called, because it will either immediately mint the NFT or add it to the failed messages to be minted later.

    mapping(uint16 => mapping(bytes => mapping(uint64 => bool))) public consumedMessage;

        function lzReceive(
            uint16 _srcChainId,
            bytes memory _srcAddress,
            uint64 _nonce,
            bytes memory _payload
        ) external override {
            
            require(!consumedMessage[_srcChainId][_srcAddress][_nonce], "already consumed");
            consumedMessage[_srcChainId][_srcAddress][_nonce] = true;

            require(_msgSender() == address(endpoint), "!Endpoint");
            (bool success, bytes memory reason) = address(this).excessivelySafeCall(gasleft()*4/5, 150, abi.encodeWithSelector(this.nonblockingLzReceive.selector, _srcChainId, _srcAddress, _nonce, _payload));
            // try-catch all errors/exceptions
            if (!success) {
                failedMessages[_srcChainId][_srcAddress][_nonce] = keccak256(_payload);
                emit MessageFailed(_srcChainId, _srcAddress, _nonce, _payload, reason);
            }
        }

## [[M-06] BondNFTs can revert when transferred](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/162)
*Submitted by [0xdeadbeef0x](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/162)*

`BondNFT`s should be transferrable. According the the proposal and the sponsor, `BondNFT`s should could be sold and borrowed against.

The proposal for context: <https://gov.tigris.trade/#/proposal/0x2f2d1d63060a4a2f2718ebf86250056d40380dc7162fb4bf5e5c0b5bee49a6f3>

The current implementation limits selling/depositing to only the same day that rewards are distributed for the `tigAsset` of the bond.

The impact if no rewards are distributed in the same day:

1.  `BondNFT`s listed on open markets will not be able to fulfill the orders
2.  `BondNFT`s deposited as collateral will not be able to release the collateral

Because other market/platforms used for selling/depositing will not call `claimGovFees` to distribute rewards, they will revert when trying to transfer the `BondNFT`.

Realistic examples could be `BondNFT`s listed on OpenSea.

Example of reasons why rewards would not be distributed in the same day:

1.  Low activity from investors, rewards are distributed when users lock/release/extend
2.  `tigAsset` is blacklisted in `BondNFT`, rewards will not be distributed in such case.

### Proof of Concept

`BondNFT` has a mechanism to update the time `tigAsset` rewards are distributed. It uses a map that points to the last timestamp rewards were distributed for `epoch[tigAsset]`.

`distribute` function in `BondNFT`: <br><https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/588c84b7bb354d20cbca6034544c4faa46e6a80e/contracts/BondNFT.sol#L221>

        function distribute(
            address _tigAsset,
            uint _amount
        ) external {
            if (totalShares[_tigAsset] == 0 || !allowedAsset[_tigAsset]) return;
            IERC20(_tigAsset).transferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), _amount);
            unchecked {
                uint aEpoch = block.timestamp / DAY;
                if (aEpoch > epoch[_tigAsset]) {
                    for (uint i=epoch[_tigAsset]; i<aEpoch; i++) {
                        epoch[_tigAsset] += 1;
                        accRewardsPerShare[_tigAsset][i+1] = accRewardsPerShare[_tigAsset][i];
                    }
                }
                accRewardsPerShare[_tigAsset][aEpoch] += _amount * 1e18 / totalShares[_tigAsset];
            }
            emit Distribution(_tigAsset, _amount);
        }

(Please note that if the asset is blacklisted through `allowedAsset`, the  `epoch[tigAsset]` will not be updated)

When `BondNFT`s are transferred, a check is implemented to make sure `epoch[tigAsset]` is updated to the current day.

According to the sponsor, the reason for this check is to make sure that a bond that should be expired doesn't get transferred while the epoch hasn't yet been updated.

`_transfer` function in `BondNFT`: 
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/588c84b7bb354d20cbca6034544c4faa46e6a80e/contracts/BondNFT.sol#L329>

        function _transfer(
            address from,
            address to,
            uint256 _id
        ) internal override {
            Bond memory bond = idToBond(_id);
            require(epoch[bond.asset] == block.timestamp/DAY, "Bad epoch");
            require(!bond.expired, "Expired!");
            unchecked {
                require(block.timestamp > bond.mintTime + 300, "Recent update");
                userDebt[from][bond.asset] += bond.pending;
                bondPaid[_id][bond.asset] += bond.pending;
            }
            super._transfer(from, to, _id);
        }

As can be seen above, if `epoch[tigAsset]` is not set to the same day of the transfer, the transfer will fail and the impacts in the impact section will happen.

### Hardhat POC

There is already an implemented test showing that transfers fail when `epoch[tigAsset]` is not updated: 

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/588c84b7bb354d20cbca6034544c4faa46e6a80e/test/09.Bonds.js#L472>

        it("Bond can only transferred if epoch is updated", async function () {
          await stabletoken.connect(owner).mintFor(owner.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("3000"));
          await lock.connect(owner).lock(StableToken.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("3000"), 365);

          await network.provider.send("evm_increaseTime", [864000]);
          await network.provider.send("evm_mine");

          await expect(bond.connect(owner).safeTransferMany(user.address, [1])).to.be.revertedWith("Bad epoch");
        });

### Tools Used

VS Code, Hardhat

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The reason for the check is to validate that a bond.expired updated according to the actual timestamp.

Instead of having

            require(epoch[bond.asset] == block.timestamp/DAY, "Bad epoch");
            require(!bond.expired, "Expired!");

You could replace it with:

     require(bond.expireEpoch  >= block.timestamp/DAY, "Transfer after expired not allowed");

## [[M-07] Trading will not work on Ethereum if USDT is used](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/198)

Traders will not be able to:

1.  Initiate a market order
2.  Add margin
3.  Add to position
4.  initiate limit order

If USDT is set as the margin asset and protocol is deployed on Ethereum.

(Note: this issue was submitted after consulting with the sponsor even though currently there are no plans to deploy the platform on Ethereum).

### Proof of Concept

`USDT` has a race condition protection mechanism on ethereum chain:

It does not allow users to change the allowance without first changing the allowance to 0.

`approve` function in `USDT` on Ethereum: <br><https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code#L205>

        function approve(address _spender, uint _value) public onlyPayloadSize(2 * 32) {

            // To change the approve amount you first have to reduce the addresses`
            //  allowance to zero by calling `approve(_spender, 0)` if it is not
            //  already 0 to mitigate the race condition described here:
            //  https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729
            require(!((_value != 0) && (allowed[msg.sender][_spender] != 0)));

            allowed[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
            Approval(msg.sender, _spender, _value);
        }

In `Trading`, if users use `USDT` as margin to:

1.  Initiate a market order
2.  Add margin
3.  Add to position
4.  initiate limit order

The transaction will revert.

This is due to the the `_handleDeposit` which is called in all of the above uses.

`_handleDeposit` calls the `USDT` margin asset `approve` function with `type(uint).max`.

From the second time `approve` will be called, the transaction will revert.

`_handleDeposit` in `Trading`: <br><https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/588c84b7bb354d20cbca6034544c4faa46e6a80e/contracts/Trading.sol#L652>

        function _handleDeposit(address _tigAsset, address _marginAsset, uint256 _margin, address _stableVault
    , ERC20PermitData calldata _permitData, address _trader) internal {
    ------
                IERC20(_marginAsset).transferFrom(_trader, address(this), _margin/_marginDecMultiplier);
                IERC20(_marginAsset).approve(_stableVault, type(uint).max);
                IStableVault(_stableVault).deposit(_marginAsset, _margin/_marginDecMultiplier);
    ------
        }

### Tools Used

VS Code

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

No need to to approve `USDT` every time.
The protocol could:

1.  Keep a record if allowance was already set on an address
2.  Create an external function that can be called by the owner to approve the a token address

In GovNFT, setMaxBridge function is provided to set maxBridge, but this variable is not used, literally it should be used to limit the number of GovNFTs crossing chain, but it doesn't work in GovNFT.

```solidity

Both `BondNFT` and `GovNFT` are an ERC721 implementation, and they both also have a function named `safeTransferMany()` which its name implies is supposed to safe transfer many tokens at once.
However the function doesn't actually safe transfer.

### Impact

Users might use this function, expecting it to verify that the receiver is an `ERC721Receiver`, but will get their funds stuck in a contract that doesn't support ERC721.

### Proof of Concept

I've added the following tests to the `GovNFT` tests.

1st test will succeed (tx will revert) since `safeTransferFrom()` does actually use safe transfer.

2nd will fail (tx won't revert), since `safeTransferMany()` doesn't actually use a safe transfer.

## [[M-10] `BondNFT.extendLock` force a user to extend the bond at least for current bond.period](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/359)
*Submitted by [carlitox477](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/359)*

The current implementation forces a user to extend their bonds for at least they current bond period. This means that, for instance, a bond which was initially locked for 365 can never be extended, even after a week of being created.

If we consider that a bond should have at least a 7 days lock and at the most 365 days, then the current `BondNFT.extendLock` function should be refactored.

### Impact

*   Current `BondNFT.extendLock` function does not work as expected, forcing user who wants to extend their bond to extend them at least for their current bond.period.
*   For bonds which were set with a lock period of 365 days, they can not be extended, even after days of their creation.

### Proof of Concept

```typescript
// In 09.Bond.js,  describe "Extending lock"
it("POC: Extending the lock does not work as expected", async function () {
      await stabletoken.connect(owner).mintFor(user.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("100"));
      // user lock bond funds for 10 days
      await lock.connect(user).lock(StableToken.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("100"), 10);

      const fiveDaysTime = 5 * 24 * 60 * 60
      const eightDaysTime = 8 * 24 * 60 * 60

      // owner distribute rewards
      console.log("User created a lock for 10 days")
      await stabletoken.connect(owner).mintFor(owner.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("10"));
      await bond.connect(owner).distribute(stabletoken.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("10"));

      // Five days pass
      await network.provider.send("evm_increaseTime", [fiveDaysTime]); // Skip 10 days
      await network.provider.send("evm_mine");
      console.log("\n5 days pass")

      // User decide to extend their lock three days, given the current implementation the user is forced to extended 13 days
      const bondInfoBeforeExtension = await bond.idToBond(1)
      console.log(`Bond info before extension: {period: ${bondInfoBeforeExtension.period}, expireEpoch: ${bondInfoBeforeExtension.expireEpoch}}`)
      
      await lock.connect(user).extendLock(1, 0, 3)

    });
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

In order to `extendLock` to work properly, the current implementation  should be changed to:

```diff
function extendLock(
    uint _id,
    address _asset,
    uint _amount,
    uint _period,
    address _sender
) external onlyManager() {
    Bond memory bond = idToBond(_id);
    Bond storage _bond = _idToBond[_id];
    require(bond.owner == _sender, "!owner");
    require(!bond.expired, "Expired");
    require(bond.asset == _asset, "!BondAsset");
    require(bond.pending == 0); //Cannot extend a lock with pending rewards
+   uint currentEpoch = block.timestamp/DAY;
-   require(epoch[bond.asset] == block.timestamp/DAY, "Bad epoch");
    require(epoch[bond.asset] == currentEpoch, "Bad epoch");

+   uint pendingEpochs = bond.expireEpoch - currentEpoch;
+   uint newBondPeriod = pendingEpochs + _period;
+   //In order to respect min bond period when we extend a bon
+   // Next line can be omitted at discretion of the protocol and devs
+   // If it is omitted any created bond would be able to be extended always (except from those with period = 365)
+   require(newBondPeriod >= 7, "MIN PERIOD");

-    require(bond.period+_period <= 365, "MAX PERIOD");
+    require(newBondPeriod <= 365, "MAX PERIOD");
    
    unchecked {
-       uint shares = (bond.amount + _amount) * (bond.period + _period) / 365;
+       uint shares = (bond.amount + _amount) * newBondPeriod / 365;

-       uint expireEpoch = block.timestamp/DAY + bond.period + _period;
+       uint expireEpoch = currentEpoch + newBondPeriod;

        totalShares[bond.asset] += shares-bond.shares;
        _bond.shares = shares;
        _bond.amount += _amount;
        _bond.expireEpoch = expireEpoch;
        _bond.period += _period;
        _bond.mintTime = block.timestamp; 
-       _bond.mintEpoch = epoch[bond.asset];
+       _bond.mintEpoch = currentEpoch;
-       bondPaid[_id][bond.asset] = accRewardsPerShare[bond.asset][epoch[bond.asset]] * _bond.shares / 1e18;
+       bondPaid[_id][bond.asset] = accRewardsPerShare[bond.asset][currentEpoch] * _bond.shares / 1e18;
    }
    emit ExtendLock(_period, _amount, _sender,  _id);
}
```

## [[M-11] `_handleOpenFees` returns an incorrect value for `_feePaid`. This directly impacts margin calculations](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/367)
*Submitted by [0Kage](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/367), also found by [chaduke](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/55)*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/588c84b7bb354d20cbca6034544c4faa46e6a80e/contracts/Trading.sol#L178> 

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/588c84b7bb354d20cbca6034544c4faa46e6a80e/contracts/Trading.sol#L734>

### Impact

Formula for `fee paid` in [Line 734](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Trading.sol#L734) is incorrect leading to incorrect margin calculations. Since this directly impacts the trader margin and associated fee calculations, I've marked as HIGH risk.

On initiating a market order, `Margin` is adjusted for the `fees` that is charged by protocol. This adjustment is in [Line 178 of Trading](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/588c84b7bb354d20cbca6034544c4faa46e6a80e/contracts/Trading.sol#L178). Fees computed by ` _handleOpenFees  ` is deducted from Initial margin posted by user.

Formula misses to account for the `2*referralFee` component while calculaing `_feePaid`.

### Proof of Concept

Note that `_feePaid` as per formula in Line 734 is the sum of ` _daoFeesPaid`, and sum of  `burnerFee`&`botFee` .  `\_daoFeesPaid`is calculated from`\_fees.daoFees`which itself is calculated by subtracting`2\*referralFee`and`botFee\`.

So when we add back `burnerFee` and `botFee` to `_feePaid`, we are missing to add back the `2*referralFee`  which was earlier excluded when calculating `_daoFeesPaid`. While `botFee` is added back correctly, same adjustment is not being done viz-a-viz referral fee.

This results in under calculating the `_feePaid` and impacts the rewards paid to the protocol NFT holders.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Suggest replacing the formula in line 734 with below (adding back `\_fees.referralFees\*2`)

                _feePaid =
                    _positionSize
                    * (_fees.burnFees + _fees.botFees + _fees.referralFees*2 ) 
                    / DIVISION_CONSTANT // divide by 100%
                    + _daoFeesPaid;

The project heavily relies on nodes/oracles, which are EOAs that sign the current price.

Since all functions (including withdrawing) require a recently-signed price, the owner(s) of those EOA can freeze all activity by not providing signed prices.

I got from the sponsor that the owner of the contract is going to be a timelock contract.
However, once the owner holds the power to pause withdrawals - that nullifies the timelock. The whole point of the timelock is to allow users to withdraw their funds when they see a pending malicious tx before it's executed. If the owner has the power to freeze users' funds in the contract, they wouldn't be able to do anything while the owner executes his malicious activity.

Besides that, there are also LP funds, which are locked to a certain period, and also can't withdraw their funds when they see a pending malicious timelock tx.

### Impact

The owner (or attacker who steals the owner's wallet) can steal all user's funds.

### Proof of Concept

*   The fact that the protocol relies on EOA signatures is pretty clear from the code and docs
*   The whole project relies on the 'StableVault' and 'StableToken'
    *   The value of the 'StableToken' comes from the real stablecoin that's locked in 'StableVault', if someone manages to empty the 'StableVault' from the deposited stablecoins the 'StableToken' would become worthless
*   The owner has a few ways to drain all funds:
    *   Replace the minter via `StableToken.setMinter()`, mint more tokens, and redeem them via `StableVault.withdraw()`
    *   List a fake token at `StableVault`, deposit it and withdraw real stablecoin
    *   List a new fake asset for trading with a fake chainlink oracle, fake profit with trading with fake prices, and then withdraw
        *   They can prevent other users from doing the same by setting `maxOi` and opening position in the same tx
    *   Replace the MetaTx forwarder and execute tx on behalf of users (e.g. transferring bonds, positions and StableToken from their account)

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

*   Rely on a contract (chainlink/Uniswap) solely as an oracle
*   Alternately, add functionality to withdraw funds at the last given price in case no signed data is given for a certain period
    *   You can do it by creating a challenge in which a user requests to close his position at a recent price, if no bot executes it for a while it can be executed at the last recorded price.
*   As for LPs' funds, I don't see an easy way around it (besides doing significant changes to the architecture of the protocol), this a risk LPs should be aware of and decide if they're willing to accept.

## [[M-13] One can become referral of hash 0x0 and because all users default referral hash is 0x0 so he would become all users referral by default and earn a lot of fees while users didn't approve it](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/379)
*Submitted by [unforgiven](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/379)*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/588c84b7bb354d20cbca6034544c4faa46e6a80e/contracts/Referrals.sol#L20-L24> 

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/588c84b7bb354d20cbca6034544c4faa46e6a80e/contracts/TradingExtension.sol#L148-L152>

### Impact

By default the value of `_referred[user]` is 0x0 for all users and if one set 0x0 as his referral hash then he would become referral for all the users who didn't set referral by default and he would earn a lot of referral funds that users didn't approve it.

### Proof of Concept

This is `createReferralCode()` code:

        function createReferralCode(bytes32 _hash) external {
            require(_referral[_hash] == address(0), "Referral code already exists");
            _referral[_hash] = _msgSender();
            emit ReferralCreated(_msgSender(), _hash);
        }

As you can see, attacker can become set 0x0 as his hash referral by calling `createReferralCode(0x0)` and code would set `_referral[0x0] = attackerAddress` (attacker needs to be the first one calling this).

Then in the `getRef()` code the logic would return `attackerAddress` as referral for all the users who didn't set referral.

        function getRef(
            address _trader
        ) external view returns(address) {
            return referrals.getReferral(referrals.getReferred(_trader));
        }

In the code, getReferred(trader) would return 0x0 because trader didn't set referred and getReferral(0x0) would return attackerAddress.

`_handleOpenFees()` and `_handleCloseFees()` function in the Trading contract would use `getRef(trader)` and they would transfer referral fee to attackerAddress and attacker would receive fee from a lot of users which didn't set any referral, those users didn't set any referral and didn't approve attacker receiving referral fees from them and because most of the users wouldn't know about this and referral codes so attacker would receive a lot of funds.

### Tools Used

VIM

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Prevent someone from setting 0x0 hash for their referral code.

## [[M-14] `BondNFT.sol#claim()` needs to correct all the missing epochs](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/392)
*Submitted by [\_\_141345\_\_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/392)*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/588c84b7bb354d20cbca6034544c4faa46e6a80e/contracts/BondNFT.sol#L177-L183> 

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/588c84b7bb354d20cbca6034544c4faa46e6a80e/contracts/BondNFT.sol#L235-L242>

### Impact

In `BondNFT.sol#claim()`, `accRewardsPerShare[][]` is amended to reflect the expired shares. But only `accRewardsPerShare[bond.asset][epoch[bond.asset]]` is updated. All the epochs between `bond.expireEpoch-1` and `epoch[bond.asset]` are missed.

However, some users claimable rewards calculation could be based on the missed epochs. As a result, the impact might be:

*   `accRewardsPerShare` is inaccurate for the epochs in between.
*   Some users could lose reward due to wrong `accRewardsPerShare`, some users might receive undeserved rewards.
*   Some rewards will be locked in the contract.

### Proof of Concept

The rationale behind the unchecked block below seems to take into account the shares of reward of the expired bond. However, if you only update the latest epoch data, the epochs in between could have errors and lead to loss of other users.

```solidity
File: contracts/BondNFT.sol
168:     function claim(
169:         uint _id,
170:         address _claimer
171:     ) public onlyManager() returns(uint amount, address tigAsset) {
    
177:             if (bond.expired) {
178:                 uint _pendingDelta = (bond.shares * accRewardsPerShare[bond.asset][epoch[bond.asset]] / 1e18 - bondPaid[_id][bond.asset]) - (bond.shares * accRewardsPerShare[bond.asset][bond.expireEpoch-1] / 1e18 - bondPaid[_id][bond.asset]);
179:                 if (totalShares[bond.asset] > 0) {
180:                     accRewardsPerShare[bond.asset][epoch[bond.asset]] += _pendingDelta*1e18/totalShares[bond.asset];
181:                 }
182:             }
183:             bondPaid[_id][bond.asset] += amount;
```

Users can claim rewards up to the expiry time, based on `accRewardsPerShare[tigAsset][bond.expireEpoch-1]`:

```solidity
235:     function idToBond(uint256 _id) public view returns (Bond memory bond) {
    
238:         bond.expired = bond.expireEpoch <= epoch[bond.asset] ? true : false;
239:         unchecked {
240:             uint _accRewardsPerShare = accRewardsPerShare[bond.asset][bond.expired ? bond.expireEpoch-1 : epoch[bond.asset]];
241:             bond.pending = bond.shares * _accRewardsPerShare / 1e18 - bondPaid[_id][bond.asset];

```

            if (_delay.actionType == _type) {
                blockDelayPassed[_id].delay = block.number + blockDelay;
            } else {
                if (block.number < _delay.delay) revert("0"); //Wait
                blockDelayPassed[_id].delay = block.number + blockDelay;
                blockDelayPassed[_id].actionType = _type;
            }
        }
    }

`\_checkDelay` enforces a delay of a specific number of block between opening and closing a position. While this structure will work on mainnet, it is problematic for use on Arbitrum. 

According to Arbitrum [Docs](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/time) `block.number` returns the most recently synced L1 block number. Once per minute the block number in the Sequencer is synced to the actual L1 block number. This period could be abused to completely bypass this protection. 

The user would open their position 1 Arbitrum block before the sync happens, then close it the very next block. It would appear that there has been 5 blocks (60 / 12) since the last transaction but in reality it has only been 1 Arbitrum block. Given that Arbitrum has 2 seconds blocks it would be impossible to block this behavior through parameter changes.

It also presents an issue for [Optimism](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/build/differences/#block-numbers-and-timestamps) because each transaction is it's own block. No matter what value is used for the block delay, the user can pad enough tiny transactions to allow them to close the trade immediately.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The delay should be measured using `block.timestamp` rather than `block.number`.

## [[M-16] `distribute()` won't update `epoch[tigAsset]` when `totalShares[tigAsset]==0` which can cause later created bond for this tigAsset to have wrong mint epoch](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/436)
*Submitted by [unforgiven](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/436)*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/588c84b7bb354d20cbca6034544c4faa46e6a80e/contracts/BondNFT.sol#L206-L228> 

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/588c84b7bb354d20cbca6034544c4faa46e6a80e/contracts/BondNFT.sol#L48-L86>

### Impact

Function `BondNFT.createLock()` creates a bond and it sets bond's mint epoch as `epoch[asset]`. Function `Lock.lock()` first calls `claimGovFees()` which calls `BondNFT.distribute()` for all assets and updates the `epoch[assets]` for all assets. So during normal bond creation, the value of `epoch[asset]` would be updated and bond would be created from `today` epoch to `today+period` epoch. But if `totalShares[tigAsset] == 0` for an asset, then `distribute()` won't update `epoch[asset]` for that asset and `epoch[asset]` will be some old epoch(will be the start time where asset is added or the time where `totalShares[_tigAsset] != 0`). This would make `createLock()` set very wrong values for bond's mint epoch when `totalShares[tigAsset] == 0`.

This would happen for the first bond that has been created for that asset always and it will happen again if for some period `totalShares[asset]` become 0, then the next bond would have wrong mint epoch. or `setAllowedAsset(asset, false)`  has been called for that asset.

### Proof of Concept

This is `distribute()` code in BondNFT contract:

    function distribute(
            address _tigAsset,
            uint _amount
        ) external {
            if (totalShares[_tigAsset] == 0 || !allowedAsset[_tigAsset]) return;
            IERC20(_tigAsset).transferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), _amount);
            unchecked {
                uint aEpoch = block.timestamp / DAY;
                if (aEpoch > epoch[_tigAsset]) {
                    for (uint i=epoch[_tigAsset]; i<aEpoch; i++) {
                        epoch[_tigAsset] += 1;
                        accRewardsPerShare[_tigAsset][i+1] = accRewardsPerShare[_tigAsset][i];
                    }
                }
                accRewardsPerShare[_tigAsset][aEpoch] += _amount * 1e18 / totalShares[_tigAsset];
            }
            emit Distribution(_tigAsset, _amount);
        }

As you can see when `totalShares[_tigAsset] == 0`, then the value of `epoch[_tigAsset]` won't get updated to today. And there is no other logic in the code to update `epoch[tigAsset]`. So when `totalShares[_tigAsset] == 0`, then the value of the `epoch[tigAsset]` would be outdated. this would happen when an asset is recently added to the BondNFT assets or when there is no bond left.

When this condition happens and a user calls `Lock.lock()` to create a bond, the `lock()` function would call `claimGovFees()` to update rewards in BondNFT but because for that asset the value of totalShares are 0, that asset `epoch[]` won't get updated and in the `BondNFT.createLock()`, the wrong value would set as bond's mint epoch.

This is `Lock.lock()` code:

        function lock(
            address _asset,
            uint _amount,
            uint _period
        ) public {
            require(_period <= maxPeriod, "MAX PERIOD");
            require(_period >= minPeriod, "MIN PERIOD");
            require(allowedAssets[_asset], "!asset");

            claimGovFees();

            IERC20(_asset).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
            totalLocked[_asset] += _amount;
            
            bondNFT.createLock( _asset, _amount, _period, msg.sender);
        }

And this is `BondNFT.createLock()` code:

        function createLock(
            address _asset,
            uint _amount,
            uint _period,
            address _owner
        ) external onlyManager() returns(uint id) {
            require(allowedAsset[_asset], "!Asset");
            unchecked {
                uint shares = _amount * _period / 365;
                uint expireEpoch = epoch[_asset] + _period;
                id = ++totalBonds;
                totalShares[_asset] += shares;
                Bond memory _bond = Bond(
                    id,             // id
                    address(0),     // owner
                    _asset,         // tigAsset token
                    _amount,        // tigAsset amount
                    epoch[_asset],  // mint epoch
                    block.timestamp,// mint timestamp
                    expireEpoch,    // expire epoch
                    0,              // pending
                    shares,         // linearly scaling share of rewards
                    _period,        // lock period
                    false           // is expired boolean
                );
                _idToBond[id] = _bond;
                _mint(_owner, _bond);
            }
            emit Lock(_asset, _amount, _period, _owner, id);
        }

If a bond gets wrong value for mint epoch, it would have wrong value for expired epoch and user would get a lot of shares by lock for small time. 

For example this scenario:

1.  Let's assume `epoch[asset1]` is outdated and it shows 30 days ago epoch. (`allowedAsset[asset1]` was false so locking was not possible and then is set as true after 30 days)
2.  During this time, because `totalShare[asset1]` was 0, the `distribute()` function won't update `epoch[asset1]` and `epoch[asset1]` would show 30 days ago.
3.  Attacker would create a lock for 32 days by calling `Lock.lock(asset1)`. Code would call `BondNFT.createLock()` and would create a bond for attacker which epoch start time is 30 days ago and epoch expire time is 2 days later and attacker receives shares for 32 days.
4.  Some reward would get distributed into the BondNFT for the `asset1`.
5.  Other users would create lock too.
6.  Attacker would claim his rewards and his rewards would be for 32 day locking but attacker lock his tokens for 2 days in reality.

So attacker was able to create lock for a long time and get shares and rewards based on that, but attacker can release lock after short time.

### Tools Used

VIM

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Update `epoch[asset]` in `distribute()` function  even when `totalShares[_tigAsset]` is equal to 0. Only the division by zero and fund transfer should be prevented when totalShare is zero and `epoch[asset]` index should be updated.

## [[M-17] User can close an order via `limitClose()`, and take bot fees to themselves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/468)
*Submitted by [0xA5DF](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/468)*

Bot fees are used when a position is opened/closed via a bot. In that case a bot fee is subtracted from the DAO fee and sent to the closing bot.
A user can use that  to reduce the DAO fees for closing an order and keeping it to themselves.

Instead of closing the order via `initiateClose()`, the user can use a proxy contract to update the stop-loss value and then `limitClose()` the order.
Since that is done in one function call, no bot can run the `limitClose()` and the bot fee will go to the user.

### Proof of Concept

The following PoC shows how a trade is closed by a proxy contract that sets the limit and closes it via `limitClose()`:

We decided on tracking the timestamp of the last limit order update, and if the order gets executed before a second has passed then the bot doesn't earn bot fees. This gives every bot a fair chance at being rewarded without incentivizing the trader to execute their own order.

## [[M-18] StopLoss/TakeProfit should be validated again for the new price in `Trading.executeLimitOrder()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/512)
*Submitted by [hansfriese](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/512), also found by [bin2chen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/353)*

The open price of a stop order might be changed during execution but it doesn't validate StopLoss/TakeProfit for the changed price.

As a result, the executed market order might be closed immediately and there would be an unexpected loss for users.

### Proof of Concept

As we can see from `executeLimitOrder()`, the open price might be changed to the current price for the stop order.

499:             } else if (!trade.direction && trade.orderType == 1) {
500:                 if (trade.price > _price) revert("6"); //LimitNotMet
501:             } else if (!trade.direction && trade.orderType == 2) {
502:                 if (trade.price < _price) revert("6"); //LimitNotMet
503:                 trade.price = _price;
504:             } else {
505:                 if (trade.price > _price) revert("6"); //LimitNotMet
506:                 trade.price = _price; //@audit check sl/tp
507:             } 
508:             if(trade.direction) {
509:                 trade.price += trade.price * _spread / DIVISION_CONSTANT;
510:             } else {
511:                 trade.price -= trade.price * _spread / DIVISION_CONSTANT;
512:             }

```
But it doesn't validate sl/tp again for the new price so the order might have an invalid sl/tp.

The new price wouldn't satisfy the sl/tp requirements when the price was changed much from the original price due to the high slippage and the order might be closed immediately by sl or tp in this case.

Originally, the protocol validates stoploss only but I say to validate both of stoploss and takeprofit. (I submitted it as another issue to validate tp as well as sl).

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Recommend validating sl/tp for the new `trade.price` in `Trading.executeLimitOrder()`.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Trading.sol#L675>

### Impact

In `Trading.sol` a [deposit](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Trading.sol#L675) or [withdrawal](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Trading.sol#L700) of tokens with decimals higher than 18 will always revert.

This is the case e.g. for `NEAR` which is divisible into 10e24 `yocto`

### Proof of Concept

Change [00.Mocks.js#L33](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/deploy/test/00.Mocks.js#L33) to:

    args: ["USDC", "USDC", 24, deployer, ethers.utils.parseUnits("1000", 24)]

Then in [07.Trading.js](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/test/07.Trading.js):

    Opening and closing a position with tigUSD output
    Opening and closing a position with <18 decimal token output

are going to fail with:

    Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: reverted with panic code 0x11 (Arithmetic operation underflowed or overflowed outside of an unchecked block)

### Tools Used

VS Code

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Update calculations in the contract to account for tokens with decimals higher than 18.

## [[M-20] Trading#initiateMarketOrder allows to open a position with more margin than expected due to _handleOpenFees wrong calculation when a trade is referred](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/542)
*Submitted by [carlitox477](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/542), also found by [koxuan](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/322)*

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/588c84b7bb354d20cbca6034544c4faa46e6a80e/contracts/Trading.sol#L178-L179> 

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/588c84b7bb354d20cbca6034544c4faa46e6a80e/contracts/Trading.sol#L734-L738>

When `initiateMarketOrder` is called, `_marginAfterFees` are calculated and then used to calculate `_positionSize`:

```solidity
uint256 _marginAfterFees = _tradeInfo.margin - _handleOpenFees(_tradeInfo.asset, _tradeInfo.margin*_tradeInfo.leverage/1e18, _trader, _tigAsset, false);
uint256 _positionSize = _marginAfterFees * _tradeInfo.leverage / 1e18;
```

The problem is that `_handleOpenFees` does not consider referrer fees when it calculates its output (paidFees), leading to open a position greater than expected.

### Impact

For a referred trade, `initiateMarketOrder` always opens a position greater than the one supposed, by allowing the use of more margin than the one expected.

### Proof of Concept

The output of `_handleOpenFees` is `_feePaid`, which is calculated [once](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/588c84b7bb354d20cbca6034544c4faa46e6a80e/contracts/Trading.sol#L734-L738), and it does not consider referralFees:

```solidity
// No refferal fees are considered
_feePaid =
    _positionSize
    * (_fees.burnFees + _fees.botFees) // get total fee%
    / DIVISION_CONSTANT // divide by 100%
    + _daoFeesPaid;
```

Then we can notice that, if the output of `_handleOpenFees` did not consider referral fees, neither would `\_marginAfterFees` do:

```solidity
uint256 _marginAfterFees =
    _tradeInfo.margin-
    _handleOpenFees(
        _tradeInfo.asset,
        _tradeInfo.margin*_tradeInfo.leverage/1e18, 
        _trader,
        _tigAsset,
        false);

// @audit Then _positionSize would be greater than what is supposed to be, allowing to create a position greater than expected
uint256 _positionSize = _marginAfterFees * _tradeInfo.leverage / 1e18;
```

### Recommended Mitigation steps

Consider referral fees when `_feePaid` is calculated in `_handleOpenFees`:

```diff
// In _handleOpenFees function
+   uint256 _refFeesToConsider = _referrer == address(0) ? 0 : _fees.referralFees;
    _feePaid =
        _positionSize
-       * (_fees.burnFees + _fees.botFees) // get total fee%
+       * (_fees.burnFees + _fees.botFees + _refFeesToConsider) // get total fee%
        / DIVISION_CONSTANT // divide by 100%
        + _daoFeesPaid;
```

## [[M-21] `executeLimitOrder()` modifies open-interest with a wrong position value](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/576)
*Submitted by [0xA5DF](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/576), also found by [Jeiwan](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/437), [KingNFT](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/431), and [HollaDieWaldfee](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/137)*

The `PairsContract` registers the total long/short position that's open for a pair of assets, whenever a new position is created, the total grows accordingly.

However at `executeLimitOrder()` the position size that's added is wrongly calculated - it uses margin before fees, while the actual position is created after subtracting fees.

### Impact

The OpenInterest would register wrong values (11% diff in the case of PoC), which will distort the balance between long and short positions (the whole point of the OpenInterest is to balance them to be about equal).

### Proof of Concept

In the following test, an order is created with a x100 leverage, and the position size registered for OI is 11% greater than the actual position created.

### Impact

After a lock has expired, it doesn't get any rewards distributed to it. But, unreleased locks cause other existing bonds to not receive the full amount of tokens either. The issue is that as long as the bond is not released, the `totalShares` value isn't updated. Everybody receives a smaller cut of the distribution. Thus, bond owners receive less rewards than they should.

A bond can be released after it expired by the owner of it. If the owner doesn't release it for 7 days, anybody else can release it as well. As long as the owner doesn't release it, the issue will be in effect for at least 7 epochs.

Since this causes a loss of funds for every bond holder I rate it as HIGH. It's likely to be an issue since you can't guarantee that bonds will be released the day they expire.

### Proof of Concept

Here's a test showcasing the issue:

```js
// 09.Bonds.js

    it.only("test", async function () {
      await stabletoken.connect(owner).mintFor(owner.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("100"));
      await lock.connect(owner).lock(StableToken.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("100"), 100);
      await stabletoken.connect(owner).mintFor(user.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("1000"));
      await lock.connect(user).lock(StableToken.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("1000"), 10);
      await stabletoken.connect(owner).mintFor(owner.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("1000"));
      await bond.distribute(stabletoken.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("1000"));

      await network.provider.send("evm_increaseTime", [864000]); // Skip 10 days
      await network.provider.send("evm_mine");

      [,,,,,,,pending,,,] = await bond.idToBond(1);
      expect(pending).to.be.equals("499999999999999999986");
      [,,,,,,,pending,,,] = await bond.idToBond(2);
      expect(pending).to.be.equals("499999999999999999986");


      await stabletoken.connect(owner).mintFor(owner.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("1000"));
      await bond.distribute(stabletoken.address, ethers.utils.parseEther("1000"));

      await network.provider.send("evm_increaseTime", [86400 * 3]); // Skip 3 days
      await network.provider.send("evm_mine");

      // Bond 2 expired, so it doesn't receive any of the new tokens that were distributed
      [,,,,,,,pending,,,] = await bond.idToBond(2);
      expect(pending).to.be.equals("499999999999999999986");

      // Thus, Bond 1 should get all the tokens, increasing its pending value to 1499999999999999999960
      // But, because bond 2 wasn't released (`totalShares` wasn't updated), bond 1 receives less tokens than it should.
      // Thus, the following check below fails
      [,,,,,,,pending,,,] = await bond.idToBond(1);
      expect(pending).to.be.equals("1499999999999999999960");

      await lock.connect(user).release(2);

      expect(await stabletoken.balanceOf(user.address)).to.be.equals("1499999999999999999986");

    });
```

The `totalShares` value is only updated after a lock is released:

```sol
    function release(
        uint _id,
        address _releaser
    ) external onlyManager() returns(uint amount, uint lockAmount, address asset, address _owner) {
        Bond memory bond = idToBond(_id);
        require(bond.expired, "!expire");
        if (_releaser != bond.owner) {
            unchecked {
                require(bond.expireEpoch + 7 < epoch[bond.asset], "Bond owner priority");
            }
        }
        amount = bond.amount;
        unchecked {
            totalShares[bond.asset] -= bond.shares;
        // ... 
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Only shares belonging to an active bond should be used for the distribution logic.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/GovNFT.sol#L287-L294>

### Impact

Calling the following `Trading._handleOpenFees` function does not approve the `GovNFT` contract for spending any of the `Trading` contract's `_tigAsset` balance, which is unlike calling the `Trading._handleCloseFees` function below that executes `IStable(_tigAsset).approve(address(gov), type(uint).max)`. Due to this lack of approval, when calling the `Trading._handleOpenFees` function without the `Trading._handleCloseFees` function being called for the same `_tigAsset` beforehand, the `GovNFT.distribute` function's execution of `IERC20(_tigAsset).transferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), _amount)` in the `try...catch...` block will not transfer any `_tigAsset` amount as the trade's DAO fees to the `GovNFT` contract. 

In this case, although the Governance NFT holder, whose NFT was minted before the `Trading._handleOpenFees` function is called, deserves the rewards from the DAO fees generated by the trade, this holder does not have any pending rewards after such `Trading._handleOpenFees` function call because none of the DAO fees were transferred to the `GovNFT` contract. Hence, this Governance NFT holder loses the rewards that she or he is entitled to.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Trading.sol#L689-L750>

```solidity
    function _handleOpenFees(
        uint _asset,
        uint _positionSize,
        address _trader,
        address _tigAsset,
        bool _isBot
    )
        internal
        returns (uint _feePaid)
    {
        ...
        unchecked {
            uint _daoFeesPaid = _positionSize * _fees.daoFees / DIVISION_CONSTANT;
            ...
            IStable(_tigAsset).mintFor(address(this), _daoFeesPaid);
        }
        gov.distribute(_tigAsset, IStable(_tigAsset).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Trading.sol#L762-L810>

```solidity
    function _handleCloseFees(
        uint _asset,
        uint _payout,
        address _tigAsset,
        uint _positionSize,
        address _trader,
        bool _isBot
    )
        internal
        returns (uint payout_)
    {
        ...
        IStable(_tigAsset).mintFor(address(this), _daoFeesPaid);
        IStable(_tigAsset).approve(address(gov), type(uint).max);
        gov.distribute(_tigAsset, _daoFeesPaid);
        return payout_;
    }
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/GovNFT.sol#L287-L294>

```solidity
    function distribute(address _tigAsset, uint _amount) external {
        if (assets.length == 0 || assets[assetsIndex[_tigAsset]] == address(0) || totalSupply() == 0 || !_allowedAsset[_tigAsset]) return;
        try IERC20(_tigAsset).transferFrom(_msgSender(), address(this), _amount) {
            accRewardsPerNFT[_tigAsset] += _amount/totalSupply();
        } catch {
            return;
        }
    }
```

### Proof of Concept

Functions like `Trading.initiateMarketOrder` further call the `Trading._handleOpenFees` function so this POC uses the `Trading.initiateMarketOrder` function.

Please add the following test in the `Signature verification` `describe` block in `test\07.Trading.js`. This test will pass to demonstrate the described scenario. Please see the comments in this test for more details.

```typescript
    it.only("Governance NFT holder, whose NFT was minted before initiateMarketOrder function is called, can lose deserved rewards after initiateMarketOrder function is called", async function () {
      let TradeInfo = [parseEther("1000"), MockDAI.address, StableVault.address, parseEther("10"), 0, true, parseEther("30000"), parseEther("10000"), ethers.constants.HashZero];
      let PriceData = [node.address, 0, parseEther("20000"), 0, 2000000000, false];
      let message = ethers.utils.keccak256(
        ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(
          ['address', 'uint256', 'uint256', 'uint256', 'uint256', 'bool'],
          [node.address, 0, parseEther("20000"), 0, 2000000000, false]
        )
      );
      let sig = await node.signMessage(
        Buffer.from(message.substring(2), 'hex')
      );
      
      let PermitData = [permitSig.deadline, ethers.constants.MaxUint256, permitSig.v, permitSig.r, permitSig.s, true];

      // one Governance NFT is minted to owner before initiateMarketOrder function is called
      const GovNFT = await deployments.get("GovNFT");
      const govnft = await ethers.getContractAt("GovNFT", GovNFT.address);
      await govnft.connect(owner).mint();

      // calling initiateMarketOrder function attempts to send 10000000000000000000 tigAsset as DAO fees to GovNFT contract
      await expect(trading.connect(owner).initiateMarketOrder(TradeInfo, PriceData, sig, PermitData, owner.address))
        .to.emit(trading, 'FeesDistributed')
        .withArgs(stabletoken.address, "10000000000000000000", "0", "0", "0", ethers.constants.AddressZero);

      // another Governance NFT is minted to owner and then transferred to user after initiateMarketOrder function is called
      await govnft.connect(owner).mint();
      await govnft.connect(owner).transferFrom(owner.getAddress(), user.getAddress(), 1);

      // user's pending reward amount should be 0 because her or his Governance NFT was minted after initiateMarketOrder function was called
      expect(await govnft.pending(user.getAddress(), stabletoken.address)).to.equal("0");

      // owner's Governance NFT was minted before initiateMarketOrder function was called so her or his pending reward amount should be 10000000000000000000.
      // However, owner's pending reward amount is still 0 because DAO fees were not transferred to GovNFT contract successfully.
      expect(await govnft.pending(owner.getAddress(), stabletoken.address)).to.equal("0");
    });
```

Furthermore, as a suggested mitigation, please add `IStable(_tigAsset).approve(address(gov), type(uint).max);` in the `_handleOpenFees` function as follows in line 749 of `contracts\Trading.sol`.

```solidity
689:     function _handleOpenFees(
690:         uint _asset,
691:         uint _positionSize,
692:         address _trader,
693:         address _tigAsset,
694:         bool _isBot
695:     )
696:         internal
697:         returns (uint _feePaid)
698:     {
699:         IPairsContract.Asset memory asset = pairsContract.idToAsset(_asset);
...
732:         unchecked {
733:             uint _daoFeesPaid = _positionSize * _fees.daoFees / DIVISION_CONSTANT;
734:             _feePaid =
735:                 _positionSize
736:                 * (_fees.burnFees + _fees.botFees) // get total fee%
737:                 / DIVISION_CONSTANT // divide by 100%
738:                 + _daoFeesPaid;
739:             emit FeesDistributed(
740:                 _tigAsset,
741:                 _daoFeesPaid,
742:                 _positionSize * _fees.burnFees / DIVISION_CONSTANT,
743:                 _referrer != address(0) ? _positionSize * _fees.referralFees / DIVISION_CONSTANT : 0,
744:                 _positionSize * _fees.botFees / DIVISION_CONSTANT,
745:                 _referrer
746:             );
747:             IStable(_tigAsset).mintFor(address(this), _daoFeesPaid);
748:         }
749:         IStable(_tigAsset).approve(address(gov), type(uint).max);   // @audit add this line of code for POC purpose
750:         gov.distribute(_tigAsset, IStable(_tigAsset).balanceOf(address(this)));
751:     }
```

Then, as a comparison, the following test can be added in the `Signature verification` `describe` block in `test\07.Trading.js`. This test will pass to demonstrate that the Governance NFT holder's pending rewards is no longer 0 after implementing the suggested mitigation. Please see the comments in this test for more details.

```typescript
    it.only(`If calling initiateMarketOrder function can correctly send DAO fees to GovNFT contract, Governance NFT holder, whose NFT was minted before initiateMarketOrder function is called,
             can receive deserved rewards after initiateMarketOrder function is called`, async function () {
      let TradeInfo = [parseEther("1000"), MockDAI.address, StableVault.address, parseEther("10"), 0, true, parseEther("30000"), parseEther("10000"), ethers.constants.HashZero];

      );
      let sig = await node.signMessage(

      const GovNFT = await deployments.get("GovNFT");
      const govnft = await ethers.getContractAt("GovNFT", GovNFT.address);
      await govnft.connect(owner).mint();

      // calling initiateMarketOrder function attempts to send 10000000000000000000 tigAsset as DAO fees to GovNFT contract
      await expect(trading.connect(owner).initiateMarketOrder(TradeInfo, PriceData, sig, PermitData, owner.address))
        .to.emit(trading, 'FeesDistributed')
        .withArgs(stabletoken.address, "10000000000000000000", "0", "0", "0", ethers.constants.AddressZero);

      // another Governance NFT is minted to owner and then transferred to user after initiateMarketOrder function is called
      await govnft.connect(owner).mint();
      await govnft.connect(owner).transferFrom(owner.getAddress(), user.getAddress(), 1);

      // user's pending reward amount should be 0 because her or his Governance NFT was minted after initiateMarketOrder function was called
      expect(await govnft.pending(user.getAddress(), stabletoken.address)).to.equal("0");

      // If calling initiateMarketOrder function can correctly send DAO fees to GovNFT contract, owner's pending reward amount should be 10000000000000000000

## [[M-24] Chainlink price feed is not sufficiently validated and can return stale price](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/655)
*Submitted by [rbserver](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/655), also found by [eierina](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/654), [0x52](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/647), [kwhuo68](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/624), [joestakey](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/466), [ladboy233](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/448), [Jeiwan](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/430), [\_\_141345\_\_](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/405), [bin2chen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/349), [yixxas](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/284), [koxuan](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/278), [8olidity](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/225), [0xdeadbeef0x](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/199), [fs0c](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/187), [0xDecorativePineapple](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/178), [Rolezn](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/165), [rvierdiiev](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/121), and [gzeon](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris-findings/issues/22)*

As mentioned by <https://docs.tigris.trade/protocol/oracle>, "Prices provided by the oracle network are also compared to Chainlink's public price feeds for additional security. If prices have more than a 2% difference the transaction is reverted." The Chainlink price verification logic in the following `TradingLibrary.verifyPrice` function serves this purpose. However, besides that `IPrice(_chainlinkFeed).latestAnswer()` uses Chainlink's deprecated `latestAnswer` function, this function also does not guarantee that the price returned by the Chainlink price feed is not stale. When `assetChainlinkPriceInt != 0` is `true`, it is still possible that `assetChainlinkPriceInt` is stale in which the Chainlink price verification would compare the off-chain price against a stale price returned by the Chainlink price feed. For a off-chain price that has more than a 2% difference when comparing to a more current price returned by the Chainlink price feed, this off-chain price can be incorrectly considered to have less than a 2% difference when comparing to a stale price returned by the Chainlink price feed. As a result, a trading transaction that should revert can go through, which makes the price verification much less secure.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/utils/TradingLibrary.sol#L91-L122>

```solidity
    function verifyPrice(
        uint256 _validSignatureTimer,
        uint256 _asset,
        bool _chainlinkEnabled,
        address _chainlinkFeed,
        PriceData calldata _priceData,
        bytes calldata _signature,
        mapping(address => bool) storage _isNode
    )
        external view
    {
        ...
        if (_chainlinkEnabled && _chainlinkFeed != address(0)) {
            int256 assetChainlinkPriceInt = IPrice(_chainlinkFeed).latestAnswer();
            if (assetChainlinkPriceInt != 0) {
                uint256 assetChainlinkPrice = uint256(assetChainlinkPriceInt) * 10**(18 - IPrice(_chainlinkFeed).decimals());
                require(
                    _priceData.price < assetChainlinkPrice+assetChainlinkPrice*2/100 &&
                    _priceData.price > assetChainlinkPrice-assetChainlinkPrice*2/100, "!chainlinkPrice"
                );
            }
        }
    }
```

Based on <https://docs.chain.link/docs/historical-price-data>, the following can be done to avoid using a stale price returned by the Chainlink price feed.

1.  The `latestRoundData` function can be used instead of the deprecated `latestAnswer` function.
2.  `roundId` and `answeredInRound` are also returned. "You can check `answeredInRound` against the current `roundId`. If `answeredInRound` is less than `roundId`, the answer is being carried over. If `answeredInRound` is equal to `roundId`, then the answer is fresh."
3.  "A read can revert if the caller is requesting the details of a round that was invalid or has not yet been answered. If you are deriving a round ID without having observed it before, the round might not be complete. To check the round, validate that the timestamp on that round is not 0."

### Proof of Concept

The following steps can occur for the described scenario.

1.  Alice calls the `Trading.initiateMarketOrder` function, which eventually calls the `TradingLibrary.verifyPrice` function, to initiate a market order.
2.  When the `TradingLibrary.verifyPrice` function is called, the off-chain price is compared to the price returned by the Chainlink price feed for the position asset.
3.  The price returned by the Chainlink price feed is stale, and the off-chain price has less than a 2% difference when comparing to this stale price.
4.  Alice's `Trading.initiateMarketOrder` transaction goes through. However, this transaction should revert because the off-chain price has more than a 2% difference if comparing to a more current price returned by the Chainlink price feed.

### Tools Used

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

            require(updatedAt > 0, "round is incomplete");

.*

## [01] Use `.call` instead of `.transfer` to send ether

`.transfer` will relay 2300 gas and `.call` will relay all the gas. If the receive/fallback function from the recipient proxy contract has complex logic, using `.transfer` will fail, causing integration issues.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Trading.sol#L588

### Recommendation

Replace `.transfer` with `.call`. Note that the result of `.call` need to be checked. 

## [02] Unbounded loop

New assets are pushed into the state variable `assets` array, at the function `BondNFT.addAsset()`.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/BondNFT.sol#L352

`Lock.claimGovFees()` will iterate all the assets.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Lock.sol#L110-L120

Currently, `assets` can grow indefinitely. E.g. there's no maximum limit and there's no functionality to remove assets.

If the array grows too large, calling `Lack.claimGovFeeds()` might run out of gas and revert. Claiming and distributing rewards will result in a DOS condition.

### Recommendation

Add a functionality to delete assets or add a maximum size limit for assets.

## [03] Use the safe variant and `ERC721.mint`

`.mint` won't check if the recipient is able to receive the NFT. If an incorrect  address is passed, it will result in a silent failure and loss of asset.

OpenZeppelin [recommendation](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol#L277) is to use the safe variant of `_mint`.

### Recommendation

Replace `_mint()` with `_safeMint()`.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/BondNFT.sol#L313

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/GovNFT.sol#L56

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/GovNFT.sol#L70

## [04] Usage of deprecated chainlink API

`latestAnswer()` from chainlink is deprecated and can return stale data.

### Recommendation

Use `latestRoundData()` instead of `latestAnswer()`. Also, adding checks for [additional fields](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/api-reference/#latestrounddata) returned from `latestRoundData()` is recommended. E.g.

```
(uint80 roundID, int256 price,,uint256 timestamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = chainlink.latestRoundData();
require(timestamp != 0, "round not complete");
require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "stale data");
require(price != 0, "chainlink error");
```

## [05] Lack of checks-effects-interactions

It's recommended to execute external calls after state changes, to prevent reetrancy bugs.

Consider moving the external calls after the state changes on the following instances:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Lock.sol#L72-L73

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/BondNFT.sol#L216-L226

## [06] Lack of zero address checks for `Trading.sol` constructor for the variables `_position`, `_gov` and `_pairsContract`

If these variable get configured with address zero, failure to immediately reset the value can result in unexpected behavior for the project.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Trading.sol#L143-L152

## [07] Add an event for critical parameter changes

Adding events for critical parameter changes will facilitate offchain monitoring and indexing.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Trading.sol#L898-L9051

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Trading.sol#L912-L920

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Trading.sol#L926-L933

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Trading.sol#L939-L941

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Trading.sol#L952-L969

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Trading.sol#L975-L979

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/utils/MetaContext.sol#L9-L11

## [08] Missing unit tests

It is crucial to write tests with possibly 100% coverage for smart contracts.

The following functions are not covered:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/GovNFT.sol#L206-L216

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/GovNFT.sol#L311-L313

### Recommendation

It is recommended to write tests for all possible code flows.

## [09] Pragma float

All the contracts in scope are floating the pragma version.

### Recommendation

Locking the pragma helps to ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using an outdated compiler version.

Note that pragma statements can be allowed to float when a contract is intended for consumption by other developers, as in the case with contracts in a library or a package.

## [10] Contract layout and order of functions

The Solidity style guide [recommends](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/style-guide.html#order-of-layout) declaring state variables before all functions. Consider moving the state variables from the GovNFT instance highlighted below to the top of the contract.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/GovNFT.sol#L263-L269

Another [recommendation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/style-guide.html#order-of-functions) is to declare internal functions below external functions. 

The instances below highlights internal above external. If possible, consider adding internal functions below external functions for the contract layout.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Trading.sol#L884

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Trading.sol#L898-L901

Furthermore, it's also recommended to declare pure and view functions at the end of a grouping.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Trading.sol#L847

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Trading.sol#L857

## [11] Use time units directly

The value `1 days` can be used directly as the constant on [L10](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/BondNFT.sol#L10) of `BondNFT.sol` is not needed.

## [12] Declare interfaces on separate files

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Trading.sol#L14-L77

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/StableVault.sol#L9-L13

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/StableVault.sol#L15-L25

## [13] Constants should be upper case

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Trading.sol#L96

## [14] Use `private constant` consistently

Replace `constant private` with `private constant`.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Trading.sol#L95

## [15] Add a limit for the maximum number of characters per line

The solidity [documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/style-guide.html#maximum-line-length) recommends a maximum of 120 characters.

Consider adding a limit of 120 characters or less to prevent large lines.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Trading.sol#L178

## [16] Declaring a `return named variable` and returning a manual value for the same function

Consider refactoring the function `MetaContext._msgSender` to use `sender` on [L25](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/utils/MetaContext.sol#L25). E.g. `sender = super._msgSender()`. This will make the function more consistent with the usage of the `return named variable` declared in the function header.

## [17] Lack of spacing in comment

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Trading.sol#L863

## [18] Critical changes should use two-step procedure

Lack of two-step procedure for critical operations leaves them error-prone. Consider adding two-step procedure on the critical functions.

Consider adding a two-steps pattern on critical changes to avoid mistakenly transferring ownership of roles or critical functionalities to the wrong address.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/BondNFT.sol#L366-L370

## [19] Missing NATSPEC

Consider adding NATSPEC on all public/external functions to improve documentation.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/TradingExtension.sol#L190

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/GovNFT.sol#L168

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/GovNFT.sol#L183

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/BondNFT.sol#L349

## [20] Interchangeable usage of uint and uint256

Consider using only one approach throughout the codebase, e.g. only uint or only uint256.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Trading.sol#L223-L224

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Trading.sol#L316-L317

## [21] Move require/validation statements to the top of the function when validating input parameters

Consider moving the validation on [L966](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Trading.sol#L966) above the conditional on [L955](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Trading.sol#L955) for `Trading.setFees()`.

## [22] Remove console.log import in `Lock.sol`

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Lock.sol#L4

## [23] Draft OpenZeppelin dependencies

OpenZeppelin contracts may be considered draft contracts if they have not received adequate security auditing or are liable to change with future development.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/StableToken.sol#L4

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/StableToken.sol#L7

### Recommendation

Consider waiting until the contract is finalized. Otherwise, make sure that the development team is aware of the risks of using a draft OpenZeppelin contract and accept the risk-benefit trade-off.

## [24] Named imports can be used

It's possible to name the imports to improve code readability. E.g. `import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";` can be rewritten as `import {IERC20} from “import “@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol”;`

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Lock.sol#L6

## [25] Imports can be grouped together

Consider importing OZ first, then all interfaces, then all utils.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Trading.sol#L4-L12

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/TradingExtension.sol#L4-L8

## [26] Constant redefined elsewhere

Consider defining in only one contract so that values cannot become out of sync when only one location is updated. 

A cheap way to store constants in a single location is to create an internal constant in a library. If the variable is a local cache of another contract’s value, consider making the cache variable internal or private, which will require external users to query the contract with the source of truth, so that callers don’t get out of sync.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/Trading.sol#L95

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/TradingExtension.sol#L11

## [27] Convert repeated validation statements into a function modifier to improve code reusability

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/BondNFT.sol#L107

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/BondNFT.sol#L330

## [28] Large multiples of ten should use scientific notation.

Using scientific notation for large multiples of ten will improve code readability.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-12-tigris/blob/main/contracts/TradingExtension.sol#L26

Total: 280 instances over 22 issues with **32421 gas** saved

Gas totals use lower bounds of ranges and count two iterations of each `for`-loop. All values above are runtime, not deployment, values; deployment values are listed in the individual issue descriptions. The table above as well as its gas numbers do not include any of the excluded findings.

## [G&#x2011;01]  Multiple `address`/ID mappings can be combined into a single `mapping` of an `address`/ID to a `struct`, where appropriate
Saves a storage slot for the mapping. Depending on the circumstances and sizes of types, can avoid a Gsset (**20000 gas**) per mapping combined. Reads and subsequent writes can also be cheaper when a function requires both values and they both fit in the same storage slot. Finally, if both fields are accessed in the same function, can save **~42 gas per access** due to [not having to recalculate the key's keccak256 hash](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ec23a57daa30a8f8ca8b9681c8ccefb0) (Gkeccak256 - 30 gas) and that calculation's associated stack operations.

## [G&#x2011;02]  State variables only set in the constructor should be declared `immutable`
Avoids a Gsset (**20000 gas**) in the constructor, and replaces the first access in each transaction (Gcoldsload - **2100 gas**) and each access thereafter (Gwarmacces - **100 gas**) with a `PUSH32` (**3 gas**). 

While `string`s are not value types, and therefore cannot be `immutable`/`constant` if not hard-coded outside of the constructor, the same behavior can be achieved by making the current contract `abstract` with `virtual` functions for the `string` accessors, and having a child contract override the functions with the hard-coded implementation-specific values.

## [G&#x2011;03]  State variables can be packed into fewer storage slots
If variables occupying the same slot are both written the same function or by the constructor, avoids a separate Gsset (**20000 gas**). Reads of the variables can also be cheaper.

## [G&#x2011;05]  Using `storage` instead of `memory` for structs/arrays saves gas
When fetching data from a storage location, assigning the data to a `memory` variable causes all fields of the struct/array to be read from storage, which incurs a Gcoldsload (**2100 gas**) for *each* field of the struct/array. If the fields are read from the new memory variable, they incur an additional `MLOAD` rather than a cheap stack read. Instead of declearing the variable with the `memory` keyword, declaring the variable with the `storage` keyword and caching any fields that need to be re-read in stack variables, will be much cheaper, only incuring the Gcoldsload for the fields actually read. The only time it makes sense to read the whole struct/array into a `memory` variable, is if the full struct/array is being returned by the function, is being passed to a function that requires `memory`, or if the array/struct is being read from another `memory` array/struct

## [G&#x2011;06]  Avoid contract existence checks by using low level calls
Prior to 0.8.10 the compiler inserted extra code, including `EXTCODESIZE` (**100 gas**), to check for contract existence for external function calls. In more recent solidity versions, the compiler will not insert these checks if the external call has a return value. Similar behavior can be achieved in earlier versions by using low-level calls, since low level calls never check for contract existence

## [G&#x2011;07]  Multiple accesses of a mapping/array should use a local variable cache
The instances below point to the second+ access of a value inside a mapping/array, within a function. Caching a mapping's value in a local `storage` or `calldata` variable when the value is accessed [multiple times](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ec23a57daa30a8f8ca8b9681c8ccefb0), saves **~42 gas per access** due to not having to recalculate the key's keccak256 hash (Gkeccak256 - **30 gas**) and that calculation's associated stack operations. Caching an array's struct avoids recalculating the array offsets into memory/calldata

## [G&#x2011;14]  Optimize names to save gas
`public`/`external` function names and `public` member variable names can be optimized to save gas. See [this](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/a5d8b486a8259f9f77891a919febd1a9) link for an example of how it works. Below are the interfaces/abstract contracts that can be optimized so that the most frequently-called functions use the least amount of gas possible during method lookup. Method IDs that have two leading zero bytes can save **128 gas** each during deployment, and renaming functions to have lower method IDs will save **22 gas** per call, [per sorted position shifted](https://medium.com/joyso/solidity-how-does-function-name-affect-gas-consumption-in-smart-contract-47d270d8ac92)

## [G&#x2011;16]  Splitting `require()` statements that use `&&` saves gas
See [this issue](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-xdefi-findings/issues/128) which describes the fact that there is a larger deployment gas cost, but with enough runtime calls, the change ends up being cheaper by **3 gas**

## [G&#x2011;19]  `require()` or `revert()` statements that check input arguments should be at the top of the function
Checks that involve constants should come before checks that involve state variables, function calls, and calculations. By doing these checks first, the function is able to revert before wasting a Gcoldsload (**2100 gas***) in a function that may ultimately revert in the unhappy case.

## [G&#x2011;20]  Use custom errors rather than `revert()`/`require()` strings to save gas
Custom errors are available from solidity version 0.8.4. Custom errors save [**~50 gas**](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ad1bd0d29a0101b25e57c293b4b0c746) each time they're hit by [avoiding having to allocate and store the revert string](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/#errors-in-depth). Not defining the strings also save deployment gas

## [G&#x2011;21]  Functions guaranteed to revert when called by normal users can be marked `payable`
If a function modifier such as `onlyOwner` is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as `payable` will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided. The extra opcodes avoided are 
`CALLVALUE`(2),`DUP1`(3),`ISZERO`(3),`PUSH2`(3),`JUMPI`(10),`PUSH1`(3),`DUP1`(3),`REVERT`(0),`JUMPDEST`(1),`POP`(2), which costs an average of about **21 gas per call** to the function, in addition to the extra deployment cost

Total: 150 instances over 8 issues with **277130 gas** saved

Gas totals use lower bounds of ranges and count two iterations of each `for`-loop. All values above are runtime, not deployment, values; deployment values are listed in the individual issue descriptions. The table above as well as its gas numbers do not include any of the excluded findings.

## [G&#x2011;23]  Using `calldata` instead of `memory` for read-only arguments in `external` functions saves gas
When a function with a `memory` array is called externally, the `abi.decode()` step has to use a for-loop to copy each index of the `calldata` to the `memory` index. **Each iteration of this for-loop costs at least 60 gas** (i.e. `60 * <mem_array>.length`). Using `calldata` directly, obliviates the need for such a loop in the contract code and runtime execution. Note that even if an interface defines a function as having `memory` arguments, it's still valid for implementation contracs to use `calldata` arguments instead. 

If the array is passed to an `internal` function which passes the array to another internal function where the array is modified and therefore `memory` is used in the `external` call, it's still more gass-efficient to use `calldata` when the `external` function uses modifiers, since the modifiers may prevent the internal functions from being called. Structs have the same overhead as an array of length one

Note that I've also flagged instances where the function is `public` but can be marked as `external` since it's not called by the contract, and cases where a constructor is involved

## [G&#x2011;24]  State variables should be cached in stack variables rather than re-reading them from storage
The instances below point to the second+ access of a state variable within a function. Caching of a state variable replaces each Gwarmaccess (**100 gas**) with a much cheaper stack read. Other less obvious fixes/optimizations include having local memory caches of state variable structs, or having local caches of state variable contracts/addresses.

## [G&#x2011;25]  `<array>.length` should not be looked up in every loop of a `for`-loop
The overheads outlined below are _PER LOOP_, excluding the first loop
* storage arrays incur a Gwarmaccess (**100 gas**)
* memory arrays use `MLOAD` (**3 gas**)
* calldata arrays use `CALLDATALOAD` (**3 gas**)

Caching the length changes each of these to a `DUP<N>` (**3 gas**), and gets rid of the extra `DUP<N>` needed to store the stack offset

## [G&#x2011;27]  Using `> 0` costs more gas than `!= 0` when used on a `uint` in a `require()` statement
This change saves **[6 gas](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/zeppelin/original/2X/3/363a367d6d68851f27d2679d10706cd16d788b96.png)** per instance. The optimization works until solidity version [0.8.13](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/bf2c3120f24a69e489f12b3213c06c94) where there is a regression in gas costs.

## [G&#x2011;28]  `++i` costs less gas than `i++`, especially when it's used in `for`-loops (`--i`/`i--` too)

## [G&#x2011;29]  Using `private` rather than `public` for constants, saves gas
If needed, the values can be read from the verified contract source code, or if there are multiple values there can be a single getter function that [returns a tuple](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-frax/blob/90f55a9ce4e25bceed3a74290b854341d8de6afa/src/contracts/FraxlendPair.sol#L156-L178) of the values of all currently-public constants. Saves **3406-3606 gas** in deployment gas due to the compiler not having to create non-payable getter functions for deployment calldata, not having to store the bytes of the value outside of where it's used, and not adding another entry to the method ID table

## [G&#x2011;30]  Use custom errors rather than `revert()`/`require()` strings to save gas
Custom errors are available from solidity version 0.8.4. Custom errors save [**~50 gas**](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ad1bd0d29a0101b25e57c293b4b0c746) each time they're hit by [avoiding having to allocate and store the revert string](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/#errors-in-depth). Not defining the strings also save deployment gas
