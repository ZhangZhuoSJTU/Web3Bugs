# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Backd Tokenomics smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between May 27—June 3 2022.

## Wardens

66 Wardens contributed reports to the Backd Tokenomics contest:

## [[H-01] `Minter.sol#startInflation()` can be bypassed.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd-findings/issues/99)
_Submitted by WatchPug, also found by 0x52_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/2a5664d35cde5b036074edef3c1369b984d10010/protocol/contracts/tokenomics/Minter.sol#L104-L108>

```solidity
    function startInflation() external override onlyGovernance {
        require(lastEvent == 0, "Inflation has already started.");
        lastEvent = block.timestamp;
        lastInflationDecay = block.timestamp;
    }
```

As `lastEvent` and `lastInflationDecay` are not initialized in the `constructor()`, they will remain to the default value of `0`.

However, the permissionless `executeInflationRateUpdate()` method does not check the value of `lastEvent` and `lastInflationDecay` and used them directly.

As a result, if `executeInflationRateUpdate()` is called before `startInflation()`:

1.  L190, the check of if `_INFLATION_DECAY_PERIOD` has passed since `lastInflationDecay` will be `true`, and `initialPeriodEnded` will be set to `true` right away;
2.  L188, since the `lastEvent` in `totalAvailableToNow += (currentTotalInflation * (block.timestamp - lastEvent));` is `0`, the `totalAvailableToNow` will be set to `totalAvailableToNow ≈ currentTotalInflation * 52 years`, which renders the constrains of `totalAvailableToNow` incorrect and useless.

        lastEvent = block.timestamp;
        if (block.timestamp >= lastInflationDecay + _INFLATION_DECAY_PERIOD) {
            currentInflationAmountLp = currentInflationAmountLp.scaledMul(annualInflationDecayLp);
            if (initialPeriodEnded) {
                currentInflationAmountKeeper = currentInflationAmountKeeper.scaledMul(
                    annualInflationDecayKeeper
                );

```solidity
    // Used for final safety check to ensure inflation is not exceeded
    uint256 public totalAvailableToNow;

```solidity
    function _mint(address beneficiary, uint256 amount) internal returns (bool) {
        totalAvailableToNow += ((block.timestamp - lastEvent) * currentTotalInflation);
        uint256 newTotalMintedToNow = totalMintedToNow + amount;
        require(newTotalMintedToNow <= totalAvailableToNow, "Mintable amount exceeded");
        totalMintedToNow = newTotalMintedToNow;
        lastEvent = block.timestamp;
        token.mint(beneficiary, amount);
        _executeInflationRateUpdate();
        emit TokensMinted(beneficiary, amount);
        return true;
    }
```

### Recommendation

Consider initializing `lastEvent`, `lastInflationDecay` in `constructor()`.

or

Consider adding `require(lastEvent != 0 && lastInflationDecay != 0, "...")` to `executeInflationRateUpdate()`.

## [[H-02] Total Supply is not guaranteed and is not deterministic.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd-findings/issues/46)
_Submitted by Picodes, also found by scaraven_

The actual total supply of the token is random and depends on when `_executeInflationRateUpdate` is executed.

### Proof of Concept

The `README` and tokenomic documentation clearly states that “The token supply is limited to a total of 268435456 tokens.” However when executing [`_executeInflationRateUpdate`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd/blob/c856714a50437cb33240a5964b63687c9876275b/backd/contracts/tokenomics/Minter.sol#L181), it first uses the current inflation rate to update the total available before checking if it needs to be reduced.

Therefore if no one mints or calls `executeInflationRateUpdate` for some time around the decay point, the inflation will be updated using the previous rate so the  `totalAvailableToNow` will grow too much.

### Mitigation Steps

You should do

```js
totalAvailableToNow += (currentTotalInflation * (block.timestamp - lastEvent));
```

Only if the condition `block.timestamp >= lastInflationDecay + _INFLATION_DECAY_PERIOD` is false.

Otherwise you should do

```js
totalAvailableToNow += (currentTotalInflation * (lastInflationDecay + _INFLATION_DECAY_PERIOD - lastEvent));
```

Then update the rates, then complete with

```js
totalAvailableToNow += (currentTotalInflation * (block.timestamp - lastInflationDecay + _INFLATION_DECAY_PERIOD));
```

Note that as all these variables are either constants either already loaded in memory this is super cheap to do.

# Medium Risk Findings (18)
## [[M-01] DoS on KeeperGauge due to division by zero](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd-findings/issues/35)
_Submitted by fatherOfBlocks_

In the **\_calcTotalClaimable()** function it should be validated that perPeriodTotalFees\[i] != 0 since otherwise it would generate a DoS in **claimableRewards()** and **claimRewards()**.<br>
This would be possible since if **advanceEpoch()** or **kill()** is executed by the InflationManager address, the epoch will go up without perPeriodTotalFees\[newIndexEpoch] is 0.<br>
The negative of this is that every time the **InflationManager** executes these two methods (**kill() and advanceEpoch()**) DoS is generated until you run **reportFees()**.<br>
Another possible case is that **kill()** or **advanceEpoch()** are executed 2 times in a row and there is no way of a perPeriodTotalFees\[epoch-1] updating its value, therefore it would be an irreversible DoS.<br>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Generate a behavior for the case that perPeriodTotalFees\[i] == 0.

**[samwerner (Backd) confirmed, but disagreed with severity](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd-findings/issues/35)**

> 
> A division by zero in `keeperRecords[beneficiary].feesInPeriod[i].scaledDiv(perPeriodTotalFees[i])`, will cause an instantaneous revert making it impossible to claim fees.
> 
> After more reading I believe that the finding is valid and can cause issues if there's one epoch without fees, if for any reason the protocol skips one epoch via `advanceEpoch`, while no [`perPeriodTotalFees`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/2a5664d35cde5b036074edef3c1369b984d10010/protocol/contracts/tokenomics/KeeperGauge.sol#L88) are increased, then, because [`keeperRecords[beneficiary].nextEpochToClaim`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/2a5664d35cde5b036074edef3c1369b984d10010/protocol/contracts/tokenomics/KeeperGauge.sol#L136`) will include the empty epoch, the `beneficiary` will not be able to receive fees.
> 
> Given that setup is necessary for this to happen, I believe Medium Severity to be more appropriate.

## [[M-02] The first AMM Staker will have control over how the shares are calculated.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd-findings/issues/100)
_Submitted by 0xNineDec_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/2a5664d35cde5b036074edef3c1369b984d10010/protocol/contracts/tokenomics/AmmGauge.sol#L147>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/2a5664d35cde5b036074edef3c1369b984d10010/protocol/contracts/tokenomics/AmmGauge.sol#L154>

### Impact

The first staker can take control of how the subsequent shares are going to be distributed by simply staking 1wei amount of the token and frontrunning future stakers. The reasons of this are related on how the variables are updated and with the amounts that the Gauge allows users to stake (anything but zero). The origin of this vulnerability relies on the evaluation of the `totalStaked` variable on its inception.

### Proof of Concept

To illustrate this attack, an environment of testing was made in order to track the token flows and how the variables are being updated and read.

The initial or border conditions taken into account are the same as the ones used by the team to perform the tests and just a few assumptions and simplifications were taken.

1.  The inflation rate is fixed for simplicity (`0.001`). This is valid within a short period of time because it is not a function of how the tokens are distributed or their flows. By tracking how the inflation rate is calculated an updated, we see that it is managed by the `currentInflationAmountAmm` within the [`Minter.sol` contract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/2a5664d35cde5b036074edef3c1369b984d10010/protocol/contracts/tokenomics/Minter.sol#L184), which value is modified by `_executeInflationRateUpdate()` three lines below the last code permalink. Its value depends on non-token balance related parameters (such as inflation decays and annual rates).
2.  For the testing environment performed by the team, a DummyERC20 was used as testing token. The same is done on the exploit environment.
3.  The controller is not used because it is used to retrieve the inflation rate and it is now fixed because of 1).

Each user state is updated whenever he calls either `stake`, `unstake` or `claimRewards`.

Steps:

*   Alice is the first staker and deposits 1wei worth of DummyERC20.
*   Bob takes one day to find out this new protocol and decides to stake 10 ETH amount of tokens (`10 * 10**decimals()`).
*   Alice, who was scanning the mempool, frontruns Bob with the same amount he was willing to stake. Her txn is mined first.
*   Then Bobs' transaction is mined for the 10 ETH worth.
*   Sometime after this, the pool is checkpointed.
*   A few days pass, and Bob wants to stake even more tokens. The same amount as before.
*   Alice frontruns him again updating her shares.
*   Bobs' transaction is mined and his shares are also updated.
*   The pool is checkpointed again. And Alice managed to increase considerably her amount of shares.

Both cases were evaluated (with and without staking 1 wei first). The attack scenario outputs a 100% more shares to Alice than Bob in comparison with the ethical/non-attack situation.

The code used to perform this test is the following:

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Further evaluation on how the variables are updated and how does the `Integral` (both each users and global one) is calculated on the pool inception is needed to patch this issue.

## [[M-03] THE first AMM Staker may not receive according rewards because of poor checkpoints](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd-findings/issues/111)
_Submitted by 0xNineDec_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/2a5664d35cde5b036074edef3c1369b984d10010/protocol/contracts/tokenomics/AmmGauge.sol#L56>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/2a5664d35cde5b036074edef3c1369b984d10010/protocol/contracts/tokenomics/AmmGauge.sol#L140>

### Impact

The first staker within the `AmmGauge` may not get the rewards if the pool is not checkpointed right after he stakes and before he wants to claim the rewards.

### Proof of Concept

A testing environment that reproduces how the protocol is going to be deployed and managed is used to evaluate this case under the following assumptions and simplifications.

1.  The inflation rate is fixed for simplicity (`0.001`).
2.  For the testing environment performed by the team, a DummyERC20 was used as testing token. The same is done on the exploit environment.
3.  The minting of tokens impact both on the inflation calculation and their balance. But this test evaluates the states just before minting (claimable balances). Following how the pools are updated, they are checkpointed in the end of the `_executeInflationRateUpdate` call. Not while staking.

In order to illustrate this scenario we will show both the vulnerable and non vulnerable situations.

Vulnerable Situation:

1.  Alice, Bob, Charlie and David are future users of the pool. They all notice the inception of this project and decide to stake.
2.  They all stake the same amount. Their transactions are mined with 1min of difference starting from Alice and finishing with David.
3.  There is no external pool checkpoint between Alice and Bob (besides the one that is triggered when Bob stakes).
4.  Sometime happens and they all want to check their accumulated reward balance. Alice accumulated much less than the others.

Non Vulnerable Situation:

*   The same as before but calling externally `_poolCheckpoint()` between Alice stake call and Bobs' and before checking the accumulated rewards.

The code to show this has a `secureCheckpoints` toggle that can be set as true or false to trigger (or not) the intermediate poolCheckpoints.

        it('First Staker Rewards Calculation', async function () { 
            
            let secureCheckpoints = false;
            let currentShare, currentStakedIntegral, balances;
            await this.ammgauge.poolCheckpoint();
            await ethers.provider.send("evm_increaseTime", [1 * 24 * 60 * 60]); // 10 days
            
            const updateStates = async (from) => { 
                currentShare = await this.ammgauge.perUserShare(from.address);
                currentStakedIntegral = await this.ammgauge.perUserStakedIntegral(from.address);
                balances = await this.ammgauge.balances(from.address);
            }

            const stake = async (to, amount) => {
                await updateStates(to)
                console.log(" ")
                // Balance before
                let balanceBefore = await this.ammgauge.balances(to.address);
                // Stake
                await this.ammgauge.connect(to).stake(amount);
                expect(await this.ammgauge.balances(to.address)).to.be.eq(balanceBefore.add(amount));
                await updateStates(to);
                console.log(" ")
            }

            const unstake = async (to, amount) => {
                await updateStates(to)
                console.log(" ")
                // Balance before
                let balanceBefore = await this.ammgauge.balances(to.address);
                // Stake
                await this.ammgauge.connect(to).unstake(amount);
                expect(await this.ammgauge.balances(to.address)).to.be.eq(balanceBefore.sub(amount));
                await updateStates(to);
                console.log(" ")
            }

            // Each user stakes tokens
            let initialStaking = ethers.utils.parseEther("10")
            console.log(" ")
            console.log("USERS STAKE");
            for (const user of users) {
            await stake(user, initialStaking)
            if(secureCheckpoints){await this.ammgauge.poolCheckpoint()};
            await ethers.provider.send("evm_increaseTime", [60 * 60]); // 1hr between stakes
            }
            console.log(" ")

            await ethers.provider.send("evm_increaseTime", [ 5 * 24 * 60 * 60]); // 5 days
            if(secureCheckpoints){await this.ammgauge.poolCheckpoint()};

            let claimableRewards = [];
            let claimedRewards = [];
            console.log(" ")
            console.log("USERS CLAIMABLE REWARDS AFTER 5 days");
            console.log(" ")
            for (const user of users) {
                let stepClaimable = await this.ammgauge.claimableRewards(user.address);
                claimableRewards.push(ethers.utils.formatEther(stepClaimable))

                let rewardsClaim = await (await this.ammgauge.claimRewards(user.address)).wait()
                claimedRewards.push(ethers.utils.formatEther(rewardsClaim.logs[0]["data"]))
            }

            console.log("Claimable calculated")
            console.log("   ALICE - BOB -  CHARLIE - DAVID")
            console.log(claimableRewards)

            console.log(" ")
            console.log("Effectively Claimed")
            console.log("   ALICE - BOB -  CHARLIE - DAVID")
            console.log(claimableRewards)
        })

The outputs for both cases are shown on the following chart. The initial staking amount is 10eth amount of the DummyERC20 token.

|         | Without Checkpoints | With Checkpoints |
| :-----: | :-----------------: | :--------------: |
|  Alice  |         6.6         |       115.5      |
|   Bob   |        111.9        |       111.9      |
| Charlie |        110.1        |       110.1      |
|  David  |        108.9        |       108.9      |

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

*   Check how is calculated the staking variables while the pool has no tokens staked and also how the updates and checkpoints are performed.

### Impact

When updating pool inflation rates, other pools see their `currentRate` being modified without having `poolCheckpoint` called, which leads to false computations.

This will lead to either users losing a part of their claims, but can also lead to too many tokens could be distributed, preventing some users from claiming due to the `totalAvailableToNow` requirement in `Minter`.

### Proof of Concept

Imagine you have 2 AMM pools A and B, both with an `ammPoolWeight` of 100, where `poolCheckpoint` has not been called for a moment. Then, imagine calling [`executeAmmTokenWeight`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd/blob/c856714a50437cb33240a5964b63687c9876275b/backd/contracts/tokenomics/InflationManager.sol#L318) to reduce the weight of A to 0.

Only A is checkpointed [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd/blob/c856714a50437cb33240a5964b63687c9876275b/backd/contracts/tokenomics/InflationManager.sol#L591), so when B will be checkpointed it will call `getAmmRateForToken`, which will see a pool weight of 100 and a total weight of 100 over the whole period since the last checkpoint of B, which is false, therefore it will distribute too many tokens. This is critical has the minter expects an exact or lower than expected distribution due to the requirement of `totalAvailableToNow`.

In the opposite direction, when increasing weights, it will lead to less tokens being distributed in some pools than planned, leading to a loss for users.

### Mitigation Steps

Checkpoint every `LpStakerVault`, `KeeperGauge` or `AmmGauge` when updating the weights of one of them.

## [[M-05] `BkdLocker#depositFees()` can be front run to steal the newly added rewardToken](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd-findings/issues/95)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

Every time the `BkdLocker#depositFees()` gets called, there will be a surge of rewards per locked token for the existing stakeholders.

This enables a well-known attack vector, in which the attacker will take a large portion of the shares before the surge, then claim the rewards and exit immediately.

While the `_WITHDRAW_DELAY` can be set longer to mitigate this issue in the current implementation, it is possible for the admin to configure it to a very short period of time or even `0`.

In which case, the attack will be very practical and effectively steal the major part of the newly added rewards.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/2a5664d35cde5b036074edef3c1369b984d10010/protocol/contracts/BkdLocker.sol#L90-L100>

```solidity
function depositFees(uint256 amount) external override {
    require(amount > 0, Error.INVALID_AMOUNT);
    require(totalLockedBoosted > 0, Error.NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS);
    IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);

    RewardTokenData storage curRewardTokenData = rewardTokenData[rewardToken];

    curRewardTokenData.feeIntegral += amount.scaledDiv(totalLockedBoosted);
    curRewardTokenData.feeBalance += amount;
    emit FeesDeposited(amount);
}
```

### Proof of Concept

Given:

*   Current `totalLockedBoosted()` is `100,000 govToken`;
*   Pending distribution fees amount is `1,000 rewardToken`;

1.  `depositFees()` is called to add `1,000 rewardToken`;
2.  The attacker frontrun the 1st transaction with a `lock()` transaction to deposit `100,000 govToken`, taking 50% of the pool;
3.  After the transaction in step 1 is mined, the attacker calls `claimFees()` and received `500 rewardToken`.

As a result, the attacker has stolen half of the pending fees which belong to the old users.

### Recommendation

Consider switching the reward to a `rewardRate`-based gradual release model, such as Synthetix's StakingRewards contract.

See: <https://github.com/Synthetixio/synthetix/blob/develop/contracts/StakingRewards.sol#L113-L132>

## [[M-06] `Minter.sol#_executeInflationRateUpdate()` `inflationManager().checkpointAllGauges()` is called after InflationRate is updated, causing users to lose rewards](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd-findings/issues/98)
_Submitted by WatchPug_

When `Minter.sol#_executeInflationRateUpdate()` is called, if an `_INFLATION_DECAY_PERIOD` has past since `lastInflationDecay`, it will update the InflationRate for all of the gauges.

However, in the current implementation, the rates will be updated first, followed by the rewards being settled using the new rates on the gauges using `inflationManager().checkpointAllGauges()`.

If the `_INFLATION_DECAY_PERIOD` has passed for a long time before `Minter.sol#executeInflationRateUpdate()` is called, the users may lose a significant amount of rewards.

On a side note, `totalAvailableToNow` is updated correctly.

### Proof of Concept

Given:

*   currentInflationAmountAmm: 12,000 Bkd (1000 per month)
*   annualInflationDecayAmm: 50%
*   initialPeriodEnded: true
*   lastInflationDecay: 11 months ago
*   \_INFLATION_DECAY_PERIOD: 1 year

1.  Alice deposited as the one and only staker in the `AmmGauge` pool;
2.  1 month later;
3.  `Minter.sol#_executeInflationRateUpdate()` is called;
4.  Alice `claimableRewards()` and received `500` Bkd tokens.

Expected Results:

*   Alice to receive `1000` Bkd tokens as rewards.

Actual Results:

*   Alice received `500` Bkd tokens as rewards.

### Recommendation

Consider moving the call to `checkpointAllGauges()` to before the `currentInflationAmountKeeper` is updated.

```solidity
function _executeInflationRateUpdate() internal returns (bool) {
    totalAvailableToNow += (currentTotalInflation * (block.timestamp - lastEvent));
    lastEvent = block.timestamp;
    if (block.timestamp >= lastInflationDecay + _INFLATION_DECAY_PERIOD) {
        controller.inflationManager().checkpointAllGauges();
        currentInflationAmountLp = currentInflationAmountLp.scaledMul(annualInflationDecayLp);
        if (initialPeriodEnded) {
            currentInflationAmountKeeper = currentInflationAmountKeeper.scaledMul(
                annualInflationDecayKeeper
            );
            currentInflationAmountAmm = currentInflationAmountAmm.scaledMul(
                annualInflationDecayAmm
            );
        } else {
            currentInflationAmountKeeper =
                initialAnnualInflationRateKeeper /
                _INFLATION_DECAY_PERIOD;

            currentInflationAmountAmm = initialAnnualInflationRateAmm / _INFLATION_DECAY_PERIOD;
            initialPeriodEnded = true;
        }
        currentTotalInflation =
            currentInflationAmountLp +
            currentInflationAmountKeeper +
            currentInflationAmountAmm;
        lastInflationDecay = block.timestamp;
    }
    return true;
}
```

## [[M-07] FeeBurner initiates swap without any slippage checks if Chainlink oracle fails ](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd-findings/issues/44)
_Submitted by Ruhum_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/main/protocol/contracts/tokenomics/FeeBurner.sol#L43-L88>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/main/protocol/contracts/swappers/SwapperRouter.sol#L414-L425>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/main/protocol/contracts/swappers/SwapperRouter.sol#L439>

### Impact

While the SwapperRouter contract isn't explicitly in scope, it's a dependency of the FeeBurner contract which *is* in scope. So I think it's valid to make this submission.

The SwapperRouter contract uses the chainlink oracle to compute the minimum amount of tokens it should expect from the swap. The value is then used for the slippage check. But, if the chainlink oracle fails, for whatever reason, the contract uses `0` for the slippage check instead. Thus there's a scenario where swaps initiated by the FeeBurner contract can be sandwiched.

### Proof of Concept

1.  multiple swaps initiated through [`FeeBurner.burnToTarget()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/main/protocol/contracts/tokenomics/FeeBurner.sol#L43-L88)
2.  SwapperRouter calls [`_minTokenAmountOut()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/main/protocol/contracts/swappers/SwapperRouter.sol#L220) to determine `min_out` parameter.
3.  [`minTokenAmountOut()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/main/protocol/contracts/swappers/SwapperRouter.sol#L414-L425) returns `0` when Chainlink oracle fails

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Either revert the transaction or initiate the transaction with a default slippage of 99%. In the case of Curve, you can get the expected amount through `get_dy()` and then multiply the value by 0.99. Use that as the `min_out` value and you don't have to worry about chainlink

 > This is intended functionality. If there is no oracle for a token, we still want to swap it, even if this presents a possible sandwich attack. It should be rare for a token to not have an oracle, and when it does we would rather accept slippage as opposed to not being able to swap it at all.

## [[M-08] Users can claim extremely large rewards or lock rewards from LpGauge due to uninitialised `poolLastUpdate` variable](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd-findings/issues/141)
_Submitted by scaraven_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/2a5664d35cde5b036074edef3c1369b984d10010/protocol/contracts/tokenomics/LpGauge.sol#L115-L119>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/2a5664d35cde5b036074edef3c1369b984d10010/protocol/contracts/StakerVault.sol#L326-L328>

### Impact

A user can claim all of the available governance tokens or prevent any rewards from being claimed in `LpGauge.sol` if sufficient time is left between deploying the contract and initialising it in the `StakerVault.sol` contract by calling `initalizeLPGauge()` OR if a new `LPGauge` contract is deployed and added to `StakerVault` using `prepareLPGauge`.

Inside `LPGauge.sol` when calling `_poolCheckPoint()`, the `lastUpdated` variable is not initalised so defaults to a value of `0`, therefore if the user has managed to stake tokens in the `StakerVault` then the calculated `poolStakedIntegral` will be very large (as block.timestamp is very large). Therefore a user can mint most current available governance tokens for themselves when they claim their rewards (or prevent any governance tokens from being claimed).

### Proof of Concept

1.  LP Gauge and StakerVault contracts are deployed
2.  Before the `initializeLpGauge()`, user A will stake 1 token with `stakeFor()` thereby increasing `_poolTotalStaked` by 1.
As the `lpgauge` address is equal to the zero address, `_userCheckPoint()` will not be called and `poolLastUpdate` will remain at 0.

3. The user can then directly call `_userCheckPoint()` and be allocated a very large number of shares. This works because `poolLastUpdate` is 0 but the staked amount in the vault is larger than 0

4. Once `initializeLPGauge()` is called, the user can then call `claimRewards()` and receive a very large portion of tokens or if `poolStakedIntegral` exceeds the mint limit set by `Minter.sol` then no one else can claim governance tokens from the lpGauge.<br>

OR

5. A new LP Gauge contract is deployed and added to the vault using `prepareGauge()`.
Follow steps 2 to 4.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Initialise `poolLastUpdate` in the constructor

 > Hi, correct me if I am wrong but there is a second scenario where this situation can be exploited as outlined in my report. If governance deploy a new LPGauge they must do it through `prepareLPGauge()` as `initializeLpGauge()` will revert. This introduces a significant delay (3 days if I'm correct) before the LPGauge can actually be initialised with `executeLPGauge()`. Therefore a user can easily monitor this contract and call `poolCheckpoint()` as soon as soon as `prepareLPGauge()` is called and the contract has no way to prevent this.

## [[M-09] BkdLocker depositFees can be blocked](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd-findings/issues/8)
_Submitted by csanuragjain_

burnFees will fail if none of the pool tokens have underlying token as native ETH token. This is shown below. Since burnFees fails so no fees is deposited in BKDLocker.

### Proof of Concept

1.  Assume RewardHandler.sol has currently amount 5 as address(this).balance (ethBalance) (even attacker can send a small balance to this contract to do this dos attack)
2.  None of the pools have underlying as address(0) so no ETH tokens and only ERC20 tokens are present
3.  Now feeBurner.burnToTarget is called passing current ETH balance of amount 5 with all pool tokens
4.  feeBurner loops through all tokens and swap them to WETH. Since none of the token is ETH so burningEth\_ variable is false
5.  Now the below require condition fails since burningEth\_ is false

<!---->

    require(burningEth_ || msg.value == 0, Error.INVALID_VALUE);

6.  This fails the burnFees function.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

ETH should not be sent if none of pool underlying token is ETH. Change it to something like below:

    bool ethFound=false;
    for (uint256 i; i < pools.length; i = i.uncheckedInc()) {
                ILiquidityPool pool = ILiquidityPool(pools[i]);
                address underlying = pool.getUnderlying();
                if (underlying != address(0)) {
                    _approve(underlying, address(feeBurner));
                } else
    {
    ethFound=true;
    }
                tokens[i] = underlying;
            }

    if(ethFound){
            feeBurner.burnToTarget{value: ethBalance}(tokens, targetLpToken);
    } else {
    feeBurner.burnToTarget(tokens, targetLpToken);
    }

## [[M-10] There are multiple ways for admins/governance to rug users](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd-findings/issues/113)
_Submitted by IllIllI, also found by 0x1f8b_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/2a5664d35cde5b036074edef3c1369b984d10010/protocol/contracts/zaps/PoolMigrationZap.sol#L61>

### Impact

A malicious admin can steal user funds or lock their balances forever.

Even if the user is benevolent the fact that there is a rug vector available may [negatively impact the protocol's reputation](https://twitter.com/RugDocIO/status/1411732108029181960).

### Proof of Concept

Unlike the original Convex code that goes to great lengths to prevent users having the ability to transfer funds/mint things, this project introduces multiple roles and new abilities that require users to place more trust in governance:

1.  Admins can initiate migrations and set the `newPool_` to be a contract that forwards funds to accounts they control

```solidity
File: protocol/contracts/zaps/PoolMigrationZap.sol   #1

61           ILiquidityPool newPool_ = _underlyingNewPools[underlying_];
62           uint256 ethValue_ = underlying_ == address(0) ? underlyingAmount_ : 0;
63           newPool_.depositFor{value: ethValue_}(msg.sender, underlyingAmount_);
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/2a5664d35cde5b036074edef3c1369b984d10010/protocol/contracts/zaps/PoolMigrationZap.sol#L61-L63>

2.  Admins can add infinite `newRewardToken`s:

```solidity
File: protocol/contracts/BkdLocker.sol   #2

70       function migrate(address newRewardToken) external override onlyGovernance {
71           _replacedRewardTokens.remove(newRewardToken);
72           _replacedRewardTokens.set(rewardToken, block.timestamp);
73           lastMigrationEvent = block.timestamp;
74           rewardToken = newRewardToken;
75       }
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/2a5664d35cde5b036074edef3c1369b984d10010/protocol/contracts/BkdLocker.sol#L70-L75>

so that `_userCheckpoint()`s, which are required to withdraw funds, revert because they run out of gas iterating over the tokens:

```solidity
File: protocol/contracts/BkdLocker.sol   #3

292       function _userCheckpoint(
293           address user,
294           uint256 amountAdded,
295           uint256 newTotal
296       ) internal {
297           RewardTokenData storage curRewardTokenData = rewardTokenData[rewardToken];
298   
299           // Compute the share earned by the user since they last updated
300           uint256 userBalance = balances[user];
301           if (userBalance > 0) {
302               curRewardTokenData.userShares[user] += (curRewardTokenData.feeIntegral -
303                   curRewardTokenData.userFeeIntegrals[user]).scaledMul(
304                       userBalance.scaledMul(boostFactors[user])
305                   );
306   
307               // Update values for previous rewardTokens
308               if (lastUpdated[user] < lastMigrationEvent) {
309                   uint256 length = _replacedRewardTokens.length();
310                   for (uint256 i; i < length; i = i.uncheckedInc()) {
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/2a5664d35cde5b036074edef3c1369b984d10010/protocol/contracts/BkdLocker.sol#L292-L310>

3.  Admins can set a malicious `feeBurner`, via the addressProvider, which just takes the fees for itself

```solidity
File: protocol/contracts/RewardHandler.sol   #4

35       function burnFees() external override {
36           IBkdLocker bkdLocker = IBkdLocker(addressProvider.getBKDLocker());
37           IFeeBurner feeBurner = addressProvider.getFeeBurner();
38           address targetLpToken = bkdLocker.rewardToken();
39           address[] memory pools = addressProvider.allPools();
40           uint256 ethBalance = address(this).balance;
41           address[] memory tokens = new address[](pools.length);
42           for (uint256 i; i < pools.length; i = i.uncheckedInc()) {
43               ILiquidityPool pool = ILiquidityPool(pools[i]);
44               address underlying = pool.getUnderlying();
45               if (underlying != address(0)) {
46                   _approve(underlying, address(feeBurner));
47               }
48               tokens[i] = underlying;
49           }
50           feeBurner.burnToTarget{value: ethBalance}(tokens, targetLpToken);
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/2a5664d35cde5b036074edef3c1369b984d10010/protocol/contracts/RewardHandler.sol#L35-L50>

4.  Admins can set an oracle that provides the wrong answers:

```solidity
File: protocol/contracts/swappers/SwapperRouter.sol   #5

452           try _addressProvider.getOracleProvider().getPriceETH(token_) returns (uint256 price_) {
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/2a5664d35cde5b036074edef3c1369b984d10010/protocol/contracts/swappers/SwapperRouter.sol#L452>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The trust-minimizing approach that Convex took was to not allow admins to change addresses. In order for things to change, an admin is allowed to completely shut everything down, and during the shut down state, users are still able to withdraw their funds. Later, the admins spin up a whole new set of contracts, and let users migrate things themselves. Something similar can be done here by having the DAO accept proposals to spawn specific contracts, and hook up specific addresses in certain ways in the new deployment.

## [[M-11] Usage of deprecated transfer to send ETH](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd-findings/issues/180)
_Submitted by peritoflores, also found by JC and StyxRave_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/2a5664d35cde5b036074edef3c1369b984d10010/protocol/contracts/swappers/SwapperRouter.sol#L140>

### Impact

Usage of deprecated transfer Swap can revert.

### Proof of Concept

The original `transfer` used to send eth uses a fixed stipend 2300 gas.   This was used to prevent reentrancy.   However this limit your protocol to interact with others contracts that need more than that to process the transaction.

A good article about that:
<https://consensys.net/diligence/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/>.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Used call instead.  For example

        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed.");

## [[M-12] Users can claim more fees than expected if governance migrates current rewardToken again by fault.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd-findings/issues/86)
_Submitted by hansfriese, also found by csanuragjain and unforgiven_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/tree/main/protocol/contracts/BkdLocker.sol#L70-L75>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/tree/main/protocol/contracts/BkdLocker.sol#L302-L322>

### Impact

Users can claim more fees than expected if governance migrates current rewardToken again by fault.

### Proof of Concept

In the migrate() function, there is no requirement newRewardToken != rewardToken.
If this function is called with the same "rewardToken" parameter, "\_replacedRewardTokens" will contain the current "rewardToken" also.
Then when the user claims fees, "userShares" will be added two times for the same token at L302-L305, L314-L317.

It's because "curRewardTokenData.userFeeIntegrals\[user]" is updated at L332 after the "userShares" calculation for past rewardTokens.
So the user can get paid more fees than he should.

### Tools Used

Solidity Visual Developer of VSCode

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

You need to add this require() at L71.

require(newRewardToken != rewardToken, Error.SAME_AS_CURRENT);

## [[M-13] Inconsistency in view functions can lead to users believing they’re due for more BKD rewards](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd-findings/issues/150)
_Submitted by SmartSek_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/2a5664d35cde5b036074edef3c1369b984d10010/protocol/contracts/tokenomics/AmmConvexGauge.sol#L107-L111>

### Impact

The view functions used for a user to check their claimable rewards vary in their implementation. This can cause users to believe they are due X amount but will receive Y.

### Proof of Concept

If the `inflationRecipient` is set, then `poolStakedIntegral` will be incremented in `claimableRewards()` but not in any other function like `allClaimableRewards()` or `poolCheckpoint()`.

If a user calls `claimableRewards()` after the `inflationRepient` has been set, `claimableRewards()` will return a larger value than `allClaimableRewards()` or the amount actually returned by `claimRewards()`.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

To make the logic consistent, `claimableRewards()` needs `if (inflationRecipient == address(0))` added to it.

## [[M-14] StakerVault.unstake(), StakerVault.unstakeFor() would revert with a uint underflow error of StakerVault.strategiesTotalStaked, StakerVault._poolTotalStaked.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd-findings/issues/87)

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/tree/main/protocol/contracts/StakerVault.sol#L391-L395>

### Impact

StakerVault.unstake(), StakerVault.unstakeFor() would revert with a uint underflow error of StakerVault.strategiesTotalStaked, StakerVault.\_poolTotalStaked.

### Proof of Concept

Currently it saves totalStaked for strategies and non-strategies separately.

uint underflow error could occur in these cases.

Scenario 1.

1.  Address A(non-strategy) stakes some amount x and it will be added to StakerVault_poolTotalStaked.
2.  This address A is approved as a strategy by StakerVault.inflationManager.
3.  Address A tries to unstake amount x, it will be deducted from StakerVault.strategiesTotalStaked because this address is a strategy already.

Even if it would succeed for this strategy but it will revert for other strategies because StakerVault.strategiesTotalStaked is less than correct staked amount for strategies.

Scenario 2.
There is a transfer between strategy and non-strategy using StakerVault.transfer(), StakerVault.transferFrom() functions.
In this case, StakerVault.strategiesTotalStaked and StakerVault.\_poolTotalStaked must be changed accordingly but there is no such logic.

### Tools Used

Solidity Visual Developer of VSCode

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

You need to modify 3 functions. StakerVault.addStrategy(), StakerVault.transfer(), StakerVault.transferFrom().

1.  You need to move staked amount from StakerVault.\_poolTotalStaked to StakerVault.strategiesTotalStaked every time when StakerVault.inflationManager approves a new strategy.

    You can modify addStrategy() at L98-L102 like this.

    function addStrategy(address strategy) external override returns (bool) {
    require(msg.sender == address(inflationManager), Error.UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS);
    require(!strategies\[strategy], Error.ADDRESS_ALREADY_SET);

    strategies[strategy] = true;
    _poolTotalStaked -= balances[strategy];
    strategiesTotalStaked += balances[strategy];

    return true;
    }

2.  You need to add below code at L126 of transfer() function.

    if(strategies\[msg.sender] != strategies\[account]) {
    if(strategies\[msg.sender]) { // from strategy to non-strategy
    \_poolTotalStaked += amount;
    strategiesTotalStaked -= amount;
    }
    else { // from non-strategy to strategy
    \_poolTotalStaked -= amount;
    strategiesTotalStaked += amount;
    }
    }

3.  You need to add below code at L170 of transferFrom() function.

    if(strategies\[src] != strategies\[dst]) {
    if(strategies\[src]) { // from strategy to non-strategy
    \_poolTotalStaked += amount;
    strategiesTotalStaked -= amount;
    }
    else { // from non-strategy to strategy
    \_poolTotalStaked -= amount;
    strategiesTotalStaked += amount;
    }
    }

## [[M-15] Potential DoS when removing keeper gauge](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd-findings/issues/71)
_Submitted by shenwilly_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/2a5664d35cde5b036074edef3c1369b984d10010/protocol/contracts/tokenomics/InflationManager.sol#L609-L618>

### Impact

When `_removeKeeperGauge` is called, there is no guarantee that the keeper gauge isn't currently in use by any `TopUpActionFeeHandler`. If it's still in use, any top up action executions will be disabled as reporting fees in `KeeperGauge.sol` will revert:

    function reportFees(
        address beneficiary,
        uint256 amount,
        address lpTokenAddress
    ) external override returns (bool) {
        ...
        require(!killed, Error.CONTRACT_PAUSED); // gauge is killed by InflationManager
        ...
        return true;
    }

If this happened during extreme market movements, some positions that require a top up will not be executed and be in risk of being liquidated.

### Proof of Concept

*   Alice registers a top up action.
*   Governance calls `InflationManager.removeKeeperGauge`, replacing an old keeper gauge. However, governance forgot to call `TopUpActionFeeHandler.prepareKeeperGauge` so `TopUpActionFeeHandler.getKeeperGauge` still points to the killed gauge.
*   Market moved and Alice's position should now be executed by keepers, however any attempt to execute will revert:
        > Keeper calls TopUpAction.execute();
        > _payFees();
        > IActionFeeHandler(feeHandler).payFees();
        > IKeeperGauge(keeperGauge).reportFees();
        > reverts as gauge is already killed
*   Governance noticed and calls `prepareKeeperGauge`  with a 3 days delay.
*   Alice's position got liquidated before the change is executed.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider adding an on-chain check to ensure that the keeper gauge is not in use before removing them.

## [[M-16] it's possible to initialize contract BkdLocker for multiple times by sending startBoost=0 and each time different values for other parameters](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd-findings/issues/136)
_Submitted by unforgiven, also found by 0x1f8b and scaraven_

function `initialize()` of `BkdLocker` suppose to be called one time and contract initialize one time. but if it's called by `startBoost=0` then it's possible to call it again with different values for other parameters. there are some logics based on the values function `initilize()` sets which is in calculating boost and withdraw delay. by initializing multiple times different users get different values for those logics and because rewards are distributed based on boosts so those logics will be wrong too.

### Proof of Concept

This is `initiliaze()` code in `BkdLocker`:

        function initialize(
            uint256 startBoost,
            uint256 maxBoost,
            uint256 increasePeriod,
            uint256 withdrawDelay
        ) external override onlyGovernance {
            require(currentUInts256[_START_BOOST] == 0, Error.CONTRACT_INITIALIZED);
            _setConfig(_START_BOOST, startBoost);
            _setConfig(_MAX_BOOST, maxBoost);
            _setConfig(_INCREASE_PERIOD, increasePeriod);
            _setConfig(_WITHDRAW_DELAY, withdrawDelay);
        }

As you can see it checks the initialization statue by `currentUInts256[_START_BOOST]`'s value but it's not correct way to do and initializer can set `currentUInts256[_START_BOOST]` value as `0` and set other parameters values and call this function multiple times with different values for `_MAX_BOOST` and `_INCREASE_PERIOD` and `_WITHDRAW_DELAY`. setting different values for those parameters can cause different calculation in `computeNewBoost()` and `prepareUnlock()`. function `computeNewBoost()` is used to calculate users boost parameters which is used on reward distribution. so by changing `_MAX_BOOST` the rewards will be distributed wrongly between old users and new users.

### Tools Used

VIM

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add some other variable to check the status of initialization of contract.

## [[M-17] Strategy in StakerVault.sol can steal more rewards even though it's designed strategies shouldn't get rewards.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd-findings/issues/85)
_Submitted by hansfriese_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/tree/main/protocol/contracts/StakerVault.sol#L95>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/tree/main/protocol/contracts/tokenomics/LpGauge.sol#L52-L63>

### Impact

Strategy in StakerVault.sol can steal more rewards even though it's designed strategies shouldn't get rewards.

Also there will be a problem with a rewarding system in LpGauge.sol so that some normal users wouldn't get rewards properly.

### Proof of Concept

1.  Strategy A staked amount x and x will be added to StakerVault.strategiesTotalStaked.

    contracts\StakerVault.sol#L312

2. Strategy A transferred the amount x to non-strategy B and StakerVault.strategiesTotalStaked, StakerVault.
    \_poolTotalStaked won't be updated.
    contracts\StakerVault.sol#L111

3. After some time for the larger LpGauge.poolStakedIntegral, B claims rewards using the LpGauge.claimRewards() function.
    contracts\tokenomics\LpGauge.sol#L52

    Inside LpGauge.userCheckPoint(), it's designed not to calculate LpGauge.perUserShare for strategy, but it will pass this condition because B is not a strategy.
    contracts\tokenomics\LpGauge.sol#L90

    Furthermore, when calculate rewards, LpGauge.poolStakedIntegral will be calculated larger than a normal user stakes same amount.
    It's because StakerVault.\_poolTotalStaked wasn't updated when A transfers x amount to B so LpGauge.poolTotalStaked is less than correct value.
    contracts\tokenomics\LpGauge.sol#L113-L117

    Finally B can get more rewards than he should and the reward system will pay more rewards than it's designed.

### Tools Used

Solidity Visual Developer of VSCode

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

I think there will be two methods to fix.

Method 1 is to forbid a transfer between strategy and non-strategy so that strategy can't move funds to non-strategy.

Method 2 is to update StakerVault.strategiesTotalStaked and StakerVault.\_poolTotalStaked correctly so that strategy won't claim more rewards than he should even though he claims rewards using non-strategy.

Method 1.
You need to modify two functions. StakerVault.transfer(), StakerVault.transferFrom().

1.  You need to add this require() at L112 for transfer().

    require(strategies\[msg.sender] == strategies\[account], Error.FAILED_TRANSFER);

2.  You need to add this require() at L144 for transferFrom().

    require(strategies\[src] == strategies\[dst], Error.FAILED_TRANSFER);

Method 2.
I've explained about this method in my medium risk report "StakerVault.unstake(), StakerVault.unstakeFor() would revert with a uint underflow error of StakerVault.strategiesTotalStaked, StakerVault.\_poolTotalStaked"
I will copy the same code for your convenience.

You need to modify 3 functions. StakerVault.addStrategy(), StakerVault.transfer(), StakerVault.transferFrom().

1.  You need to move staked amount from StakerVault.\_poolTotalStaked to StakerVault.strategiesTotalStaked every time when StakerVault.inflationManager approves a new strategy.

    You can modify addStrategy() at L98-L102 like this.

    function addStrategy(address strategy) external override returns (bool) {
        require(msg.sender == address(inflationManager), Error.UNAUTHORIZED_ACCESS);
        require(!strategies\[strategy], Error.ADDRESS_ALREADY_SET);

        strategies\[strategy] = true;
        \_poolTotalStaked -= balances\[strategy];
        strategiesTotalStaked += balances\[strategy];

        return true;
    }

2.  You need to add below code at L126 of transfer() function.

    if(strategies\[msg.sender] != strategies\[account]) {
        if(strategies\[msg.sender]) { // from strategy to non-strategy
            \_poolTotalStaked += amount;
            strategiesTotalStaked -= amount;
        }
        else { // from non-strategy to strategy
            \_poolTotalStaked -= amount;
            strategiesTotalStaked += amount;
        }
    }

3.  You need to add below code at L170 of transferFrom() function.

    if(strategies\[src] != strategies\[dst]) {
        if(strategies\[src]) { // from strategy to non-strategy
            \_poolTotalStaked += amount;
            strategiesTotalStaked -= amount;
        }
        else { // from non-strategy to strategy
            \_poolTotalStaked -= amount;
            strategiesTotalStaked += amount;
        }
    }

## [[M-18] Fees from delisted pool still in reward handler will become stuck after delisting](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd-findings/issues/135)
_Submitted by 0x52_

Unclaimed fees from pool will be stuck.

### Proof of Concept

When delisting a pool the pool's reference is removed from address provider:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/2a5664d35cde5b036074edef3c1369b984d10010/protocol/contracts/Controller.sol#L63>

Burning fees calls a dynamic list of all pools which no longer contains the delisted pool:

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/2a5664d35cde5b036074edef3c1369b984d10010/protocol/contracts/RewardHandler.sol#L39>

Since the list no longer contains the pool those fees will not be processed and will remain stuck in the contract

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Call burnFees() before delisting a pool.

## [L-01] `migrate()` still does transfers when the transfer is to the same pool, and this can be done multiple times
There's no check that the old address isn't the same as the new address, and there's no check that the migration has already happened

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: protocol/contracts/zaps/PoolMigrationZap.sol   #1

52       function migrate(address oldPoolAddress_) public override {
53           ILiquidityPool oldPool_ = ILiquidityPool(oldPoolAddress_);
54           IERC20 lpToken_ = IERC20(oldPool_.getLpToken());
55           uint256 lpTokenAmount_ = lpToken_.balanceOf(msg.sender);
56           require(lpTokenAmount_ != 0, "No LP Tokens");
57           require(oldPool_.getWithdrawalFee(msg.sender, lpTokenAmount_) == 0, "withdrawal fee not 0");
58:          lpToken_.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), lpTokenAmount_);
```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/2a5664d35cde5b036074edef3c1369b984d10010/protocol/contracts/zaps/PoolMigrationZap.sol#L52-L58

## [L-02] Non-exploitable reentrancy
There is no reentrancy guard in this function, and if used with a token that has transfer callbacks, such as an ERC777, the caller can reenter before `balances` is updated. I don't currently see a way to exploit this

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: protocol/contracts/tokenomics/AmmGauge.sol   #1

130          uint256 oldBal = IERC20(ammToken).balanceOf(address(this));
131          IERC20(ammToken).safeTransfer(dst, amount);
132          uint256 newBal = IERC20(ammToken).balanceOf(address(this));
133          uint256 unstaked = oldBal - newBal;
134          balances[msg.sender] -= unstaked;
135:         totalStaked -= unstaked;
```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/2a5664d35cde5b036074edef3c1369b984d10010/protocol/contracts/tokenomics/AmmGauge.sol#L130-L135

## [L-03] Users can DOS themselves by executing `prepareUnlock(0)` many times
There's no check on the amount, and every call add another entry to an array. When the user finally calls `executeUnlocks()` they'll run out of gas

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: protocol/contracts/BkdLocker.sol   #1

118      function prepareUnlock(uint256 amount) external override {
119          require(
120              totalStashed[msg.sender] + amount <= balances[msg.sender],
121              "Amount exceeds locked balance"
122:         );
```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd/blob/2a5664d35cde5b036074edef3c1369b984d10010/protocol/contracts/BkdLocker.sol#L118-L122

## [L-04] Unused/empty `receive()`/`fallback()` function
If the intention is for the Ether to be used, the function should call another function, otherwise it should revert (e.g. `require(msg.sender == address(weth))`)

*There are 3 instances of this issue:*

File: protocol/contracts/zaps/PoolMigrationZap.sol   #1

## [L-05] `safeApprove()` is deprecated
[Deprecated](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/bfff03c0d2a59bcd8e2ead1da9aed9edf0080d05/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L38-L45) in favor of `safeIncreaseAllowance()` and `safeDecreaseAllowance()`. If only setting the initial allowance to the value that means infinite, `safeIncreaseAllowance()` can be used instead

## [L-07] `_prepareDeadline()`, `_setConfig()`, and `_executeDeadline()` should be `private`
I flagged this in the last Backd contest, but it doesn't seem to have been addressed, so bringing it up again: These functions have the ability to bypass the timelocks of every setting. No contract besides the `Preparable` contract itself should need to call these functions, and having them available will lead to exploits. The contracts that currently call `_setConfig()` in their constructors should be given a new function `_initConfig()` for this purpose. The `Vault` [calls](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-backd/blob/c856714a50437cb33240a5964b63687c9876275b/backd/contracts/vault/Vault.sol#L222) some of these functions as well, and should be changed to manually inspect the deadline rather than mucking with the internals, which is error-prone. The mappings should also be made `private`, and there should be public getters to read their values

## [N-02] Return values of `approve()` not checked
Not all `IERC20` implementations `revert()` when there's a failure in `approve()`. The function signature has a `boolean` return value and they indicate errors that way instead. By not checking the return value, operations that should have marked as failed, may potentially go through without actually approving anything

## [N-07] Constant redefined elsewhere
Consider defining in only one contract so that values cannot become out of sync when only one location is updated. A [cheap way](https://medium.com/coinmonks/gas-cost-of-solidity-library-functions-dbe0cedd4678) to store constants in a single location is to create an `internal constant` in a `library`. If the variable is a local cache of another contract's value, consider making the cache variable internal or private, which will require external users to query the contract with the source of truth, so that callers don't get out of sync.

**[Alex the Entreprenerd (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd-findings/issues/109#issuecomment-1159843872):**
> **1. migrate() still does transfers when the transfer is to the same pool, and this can be done multiple times**<br>
>Interesting finding, also wonder if this could cause issues with fees, but in lack of POC, I think this is a valid Low Severity finding

> **2. Non-exploitable reentrancy**<br>
>Agree with severity and finding, would rephrase to "code doesn't conform to CEI"

> **3. Users can DOS themselves by executing prepareUnlock(0) many times**<br>
>This should be downgraded to non-critical because it probably requires tens of thousands of calls, that said the finding is valid

> **4. Unused/empty receive()/fallback() function**<br>
>I fail to see the need for the extra checks given that the contracts are meant to handle ETH

> **5. safeApprove() is deprecated**<br>
>Technically valid, however the code is using `safeApprove` correctly, only once, from zero to X

> **6. Missing checks for address(0x0) when assigning values to address state variables**<br>
>Valid

> **7. _prepareDeadline(), _setConfig(), and _executeDeadline() should be private**<br>
>Disagree with the alarmist side, but there's validity to this finding.

> **Non-critical Issues**<br>
>Agree with the findings although it feels like a bot wrote this.

>Overall a really exhaustive report, 3 findings are interesting the rest doesn't stand out, however the thoroughness of the report does.

## [1] Multiple `address` mappings can be combined into a single `mapping` of an `address` to a `struct`, where appropriate
Saves a storage slot for the mapping. Depending on the circumstances and sizes of types, can avoid a Gsset (**20000 gas**) per mapping combined. Reads and subsequent writes can also be cheaper when a function requires both values and they both fit in the same storage slot. Finally, if both fields are accessed in the same function, can save **~42 gas per access** due to [not having to recalculate the key's keccak256 hash](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ec23a57daa30a8f8ca8b9681c8ccefb0) (Gkeccak256 - **30 gas**) and that calculation's associated stack operations.

## [2] State variables only set in the constructor should be declared `immutable`
Avoids a Gsset (**20000 gas**) in the constructor, and replaces each Gwarmacces (**100 gas**) with a `PUSH32` (**3 gas**).

## [3] State variables can be packed into fewer storage slots
If variables occupying the same slot are both written the same function or by the constructor, avoids a separate Gsset (**20000 gas**). Reads of the variables can also be cheaper

## [4] State variables should be cached in stack variables rather than re-reading them from storage
The instances below point to the second+ access of a state variable within a function. Caching of a state variable replace each Gwarmaccess (**100 gas**) with a much cheaper stack read. Other less obvious fixes/optimizations include having local memory caches of state variable structs, or having local caches of state variable contracts/addresses.

## [5] Multiple accesses of a mapping/array should use a local variable cache
The instances below point to the second+ access of a value inside a mapping/array, within a function. Caching a mapping's value in a local `storage` variable when the value is accessed [multiple times](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ec23a57daa30a8f8ca8b9681c8ccefb0), saves **~42 gas per access** due to not having to recalculate the key's keccak256 hash (Gkeccak256 - **30 gas**) and that calculation's associated stack operations. Caching an array's struct avoids recalculating the array offsets into memory

## [10] `<array>.length` should not be looked up in every loop of a `for`-loop
The overheads outlined below are _PER LOOP_, excluding the first loop
* storage arrays incur a Gwarmaccess (**100 gas**)

* calldata arrays use `CALLDATALOAD` (**3 gas**)

Caching the length changes each of these to a `DUP<N>` (**3 gas**), and gets rid of the extra `DUP<N>` needed to store the stack offset

## [15] Usage of `uints`/`ints` smaller than 32 bytes (256 bits) incurs overhead
> When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contract’s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/internals/layout_in_storage.html
Use a larger size then downcast where needed

## [19] Empty blocks should be removed or emit something 
The code should be refactored such that they no longer exist, or the block should do something useful, such as emitting an event or reverting. If the contract is meant to be extended, the contract should be `abstract` and the function signatures be added without any default implementation. If the block is an empty if-statement block to avoid doing subsequent checks in the else-if/else conditions, the else-if/else conditions should be nested under the negation of the if-statement, because they involve different classes of checks, which may lead to the introduction of errors when the code is later modified (`if(x){}else if(y){...}else{...}` => `if(!x){if(y){...}else{...}}`)

## [20] Use custom errors rather than `revert()`/`require()` strings to save deployment gas
Custom errors are available from solidity version 0.8.4. The instances below match or exceed that version

### 21. Functions guaranteed to revert when called by normal users can be marked `payable`
If a function modifier such as `onlyOwner` is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as `payable` will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided. The extra opcodes avoided are 
`CALLVALUE`(2),`DUP1`(3),`ISZERO`(3),`PUSH2`(3),`JUMPI`(10),`PUSH1`(3),`DUP1`(3),`REVERT`(0),`JUMPDEST`(1),`POP`(2), which costs an average of about **21 gas per call** to the function, in addition to the extra deployment cost

>View a [detailed breakdown](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-backd-findings/issues/108#issuecomment-1159275418) of the judge's considerations.

>This is hands down the best gas report I've ever reviewed, there's only two improvements I'd recommend:
>- Post all the extra details as separate gists to make it easier to scan vs read
>- Show total gas saved in one line for each finding

>This would make it easier to score, review for the sponsor and immediately gives a sense of value to the findings

>Additionally a couple of the findings, which are completely valid, would require more detailed POC to be actionable and helpful, hence I gave them no points.

>That said this is the best I've seen so far!

>Total Gas Saved:
>7415
