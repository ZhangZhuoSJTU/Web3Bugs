# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Cally smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between May 10—May 14 2022.

# High Risk Findings (3)
## [[H-01] no-revert-on-transfer ERC20 tokens can be drained](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cally-findings/issues/89)
_Submitted by Ruhum, also found by oyc_109 and smiling_heretic_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cally/blob/main/contracts/src/Cally.sol#L198-L200>

### Impact

Some ERC20 tokens don't throw but just return false when a transfer fails. This can be abused to trick the `createVault()` function to initialize the vault without providing any tokens. A good example of such a token is *ZRX*: [Etherscan code](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498#code#L64)

When such a vault is initialized, another user can both buy and exercise the option without ever receiving any funds. The creator of the vault does receive the buyer's Ether tho. So it can cause a loss of funds.

### Proof of Concept

The trick is to create a vault with an ERC20 token but use ERC721 as the vault's type. Then, instead of calling `safeTransferFrom()` the function calls `transferFrom()` which won't catch the token returning false.

Here's a test that showcases the issue:

```solidity
// CreateVault.t.sol
    function testStealFunds() public {
        // address of 0x on mainnet
        address t = address(0xE41d2489571d322189246DaFA5ebDe1F4699F498);
        vm.startPrank(babe);
        require(ERC20(t).balanceOf(babe) == 0);
        uint vaultId = c.createVault(100, t, 1, 1, 1, 0, Cally.TokenType.ERC721);
        // check that neither the Cally contract nor the vault creator
        // had any 0x tokens
        require(ERC20(t).balanceOf(babe) == 0);
        require(ERC20(t).balanceOf(address(c)) == 0);

        // check whether vault was created properly
        Cally.Vault memory v = c.vaults(vaultId);
        require(v.token == t);
        require(v.tokenIdOrAmount == 100);
        vm.stopPrank();
        // So now there's a vault for 100 0x tokens although the Cally contract doesn't
        // have any.
        // If someone buys & exercises the option they won't receive any tokens.
        uint premium = 0.025 ether;
        uint strike = 2 ether;
        require(address(c).balance == 0, "shouldn't have any balance at the beginning");
        require(payable(address(this)).balance > 0, "not enough balance");

        uint optionId = c.buyOption{value: premium}(vaultId);
        c.exercise{value: strike}(optionId);

        // buyer of option (`address(this)`) got zero 0x tokens
        // But buyer lost their Ether
        require(ERC20(t).balanceOf(address(this)) == 0);
        require(address(c).balance > 0, "got some money");
    }
```

To run it, you need to use forge's forking mode: `forge test --fork-url <alchemy/infura URL> --match testStealFunds`

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

I think the easiest solution is to use `safeTransferFrom()` when the token is of type ERC721. Since the transfer is at the end of the function there shouldn't be any risk of reentrancy. If someone passes an ERC20 address with type ERC721, the `safeTransferFrom()` call would simply fail since that function signature shouldn't exist on ERC20 tokens.

## [[H-02] Inefficiency in the Dutch Auction due to lower duration](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cally-findings/issues/138)
_Submitted by hubble, also found by Hawkeye and sseefried_

The vulnerability or bug is in the implementation of the function getDutchAuctionStrike()
The AUCTION_DURATION is defined as 24 hours, and consider that the dutchAuctionReserveStrike (or reserveStrike) will never be set to 0 by user.

Now if a vault is created with startingStrike value of 55 and reserveStrike of 13.5 , the auction price will drop from 55 to 13.5 midway at \~12 hours.
So, after 12 hours from start of auction, the rate will be constant at reserveStrike of 13.5, and remaining time of 12 hours of auction is a waste.

Some other examples :

    startStrike, reserveStrike, time-to-reach-reserveStrike
    55 , 13.5  , ~12 hours
    55 , 5     , ~16.7 hours
    55 , 1.5   , ~20 hours
    5  , 1.5   , ~11 hours

### Impact

The impact is high wrt Usability, where users have reduced available time to participate in the auction (when price is expected to change).
The vault-Creators or the option-Buyers may or may not be aware of this inefficiency, i.e., how much effective time is available for auction.

### Proof of Concept

Contract : Cally.sol
Function : getDutchAuctionStrike ()

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The function getDutchAuctionStrike() can be modified such that price drops to the reserveStrike exactly at 24 hours from start of auction.

            /*
                delta = max(auctionEnd - currentTimestamp, 0)
                progress = delta / auctionDuration
                auctionStrike = progress^2 * (startingStrike - reserveStrike)             << Changes here
                strike = auctionStrike + reserveStrike                                    << Changes here
            */
            uint256 delta = auctionEndTimestamp > block.timestamp ? auctionEndTimestamp - block.timestamp : 0;
            uint256 progress = (1e18 * delta) / AUCTION_DURATION;
            uint256 auctionStrike = (progress * progress * (startingStrike-reserveStrike)) / (1e18 * 1e18);

            strike = auctionStrike + reserveStrike;

**[outdoteth (Cally) confirmed, disagreed with severity and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cally-findings/issues/138#issuecomment-1126980017):**
 > We think this should be bumped to high severity. It would be easy for a user to create an auction that declines significantly faster than what they would have assumed - even over 1 or 2 blocks. It makes no sense for the auction to ever behave in this way and would result in options getting filled at very bad prices for the creator of the vault.

_Submitted by WatchPug, also found by 0xsanson, BondiPestControl, and IllIllI_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cally/blob/1849f9ee12434038aa80753266ce6a2f2b082c59/contracts/src/Cally.sol#L158-L201>

```solidity
function createVault(
    uint256 tokenIdOrAmount,
    address token,
    ...
) external returns (uint256 vaultId) {
    ...
    Vault memory vault = Vault({
        ...
    });

    // vault index should always be odd
    vaultIndex += 2;
    vaultId = vaultIndex;
    _vaults[vaultId] = vault;

    // give msg.sender vault token
    _mint(msg.sender, vaultId);

    emit NewVault(vaultId, msg.sender, token);

    // transfer the NFTs or ERC20s to the contract
    vault.tokenType == TokenType.ERC721
        ? ERC721(vault.token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), vault.tokenIdOrAmount)
        : ERC20(vault.token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), vault.tokenIdOrAmount);
}
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cally/blob/1849f9ee12434038aa80753266ce6a2f2b082c59/contracts/src/Cally.sol#L23-L34>

```solidity
import "solmate/utils/SafeTransferLib.sol";

...

contract Cally is CallyNft, ReentrancyGuard, Ownable {
    using SafeTransferLib for ERC20;
    ...
```

When creating a new vault, solmate's `SafeTransferLib` is used for pulling `vault.token` from the caller's account, this issue won't exist if OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 is used instead.

That's because there is a subtle difference between the implementation of solmate's `SafeTransferLib` and OZ's `SafeERC20`:

OZ's `SafeERC20` checks if the token is a contract or not, solmate's `SafeTransferLib` does not.

See: <https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate/blob/main/src/utils/SafeTransferLib.sol#L9>

> Note that none of the functions in this library check that a token has code at all! That responsibility is delegated to the caller.

As a result, when the token's address has no code, the transaction will just succeed with no error.

This attack vector was made well-known by the qBridge hack back in Jan 2022.

For our project, this alone still won't be a problem, a vault created and wrongfully accounted for a certain amount of balance for a non-existing token won't be much of a problem, there will be no fund loss as long as the token stays that way (being non-existing).

However, it's becoming popular for protocols to deploy their token across multiple networks and when they do so, a common practice is to deploy the token contract from the same deployer address and with the same nonce so that the token address can be the same for all the networks.

For example: $1INCH is using the same token address for both Ethereum and BSC; Gelato's $GEL token is using the same token address for Ethereum, Fantom and Polygon.

A sophisticated attacker can exploit it by taking advantage of that and setting traps on multiple potential tokens to steal from the future users that deposits with such tokens.

### Proof of Concept

Given:

*   ProjectA has TokenA on another network;
*   ProjectB has TokenB on another network;
*   ProjectC has TokenC on another network;

1.  The attacker `createVault()` for `TokenA`, `TokenB`, and `TokenC` with `10000e18` as `tokenIdOrAmount` each;
2.  A few months later, ProjectB lunched `TokenB` on the local network at the same address;
3.  Alice created a vault with `11000e18 TokenB`;
4.  The attacker called `initiateWithdraw()` and then `withdraw()` to receive `10000e18 TokenB`.

In summary, one of the traps set by the attacker was activated by the deployment of  `TokenB` and Alice was the victim. As a result, `10000e18 TokenB` was stolen by the attacker.

### Recommendation

Consider using OZ's `SafeERC20` instead.

# Medium Risk Findings (10)
## [[M-01] Owner can modify the feeRate on existing vaults and steal the strike value on exercise](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cally-findings/issues/47)
_Submitted by IllIllI, also found by_ _Adam, 0x52, 0xf15ers, 0xsanson, berndartmueller, Bludya, BondiPestControl, catchup, crispymangoes, Czar102, eccentricexit, ellahi, GimelSec, hake, horsefacts, hubble, joestakey, Kumpa, pedroais, peritoflores, reassor, shenwilly, shung, smiling_heretic, sseefried, and throttle_

Owner can steal the exercise cost which should have gone to the option seller

### Proof of Concept

There are no restrictions on when the owner can set the `feeRate`:

```solidity
File: contracts/src/Cally.sol   #1

117       /// @notice Sets the fee that is applied on exercise
118       /// @param feeRate_ The new fee rate: fee = 1% = (1 / 100) * 1e18
119       function setFee(uint256 feeRate_) external onlyOwner {
120           feeRate = feeRate_;
121       }
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cally/blob/1849f9ee12434038aa80753266ce6a2f2b082c59/contracts/src/Cally.sol#L117-L121>

By using a rate that consumes the exercise cost, the owner can steal Ether from the seller:

```solidity
File: contracts/src/Cally.sol   #2

282           uint256 fee = 0;
283           if (feeRate > 0) {
284               fee = (msg.value * feeRate) / 1e18;
285               protocolUnclaimedFees += fee;
286           }
287   
288           // increment vault beneficiary's ETH balance
289           ethBalance[getVaultBeneficiary(vaultId)] += msg.value - fee;
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cally/blob/1849f9ee12434038aa80753266ce6a2f2b082c59/contracts/src/Cally.sol#L282-L289>

The owner can wait for a particularly large-value NFT, snipe that one option, then retire

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Fix the fee rate per vault during vault creation

## [[M-02] It shouldn’t be possible to create a vault with Cally’ own token](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cally-findings/issues/224)
_Submitted by p4st13r4, also found by GimelSec, TrungOre, and VAD37_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cally/blob/main/contracts/src/Cally.sol#L193>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cally/blob/main/contracts/src/Cally.sol#L199>

### Impact

Affected code:

*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cally/blob/main/contracts/src/Cally.sol#L193>
*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cally/blob/main/contracts/src/Cally.sol#L199>

Currently it’s possible to create an ERC-721 vault using Cally’ own address as `token`, and using the freshly minted vault id as `tokenIdOrAmount`. This results in a new vault whose ownership is passed to Cally contract immediately upon creation.

The vault allows users to perform `buyOption` and increase the ETH balance of the Cally contract itself, which is still the vault beneficiary. As soon as an user calls `exercise`, she will receive the `vault.tokenIdOrAmount` in exchange, which in this case coincides with the vault nft. However this is of no good because the final user may just initiate a withdrawal, which will:

*   always fail because the vault id is burned (<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cally/blob/main/contracts/src/Cally.sol#L335>) and then transferred back to the user (<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cally/blob/main/contracts/src/Cally.sol#L344>)
*   leave all the ETH unredemable in Cally contract

So the vault will be unusable and the ETH deposited by users to buy/exercise options will remain locked in Cally contract

### Proof of Concept

*   Current vault id is, let’s say, 11
*   User deploys a vault with Cally’ address as `token` and `13` as `tokenIdOrAmount`
*   Since `createVault()` mints the vault token to the user, and then transfers the underlying address from the user, an user is able to create a vault with something she doesn’t own at the moment of the `createVault()` function call, because it’s created while the function runs
*   The vault `13` is pretty limited in functionality, because Cally’ smart contract is the owner
*   However, users can still buy options: so Alice and Bob deposit their premiums
*   Whoever `exercise` the active option, becomes the vault owner now; this is of no good because no one can actually call `withdraw()` as it will always revert, and no one can recover the ETH deposited by Alice and Bob as they are locked forever

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add the following check at the start of `createVault()`:

```jsx

## [[M-03] User's may accidentally overpay in `buyOption()` and the excess will be paid to the vault creator](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cally-findings/issues/84)
_Submitted by BondiPestControl, also found by 0xf15ers, berndartmueller, cccz, csanuragjain, dipp, GimelSec, hake, horsefacts, IllIllI, jayjonah8, m9800, MadWookie, MiloTruck, pedroais, Ruhum, throttle, and VAD37_

It is possible for a user purchasing an option to accidentally overpay the premium during `buyOption()`.

Any excess funds paid for in excess of the premium will be transferred to the vault creator.

The premium is fixed at the time the vault is first created by `vault.premiumIndex`. Hence there is no need to allow users to overpay since there will be no benefit.

### Proof of Concept

`buyOption()` allows `msg.value > premium`

```solidity
        uint256 premium = getPremium(vaultId);
        require(msg.value >= premium, "Incorrect ETH amount sent");
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider modifying the check such that the `msg.value` is exactly equal to the `premuim`. e.g.

```solidity
        uint256 premium = getPremium(vaultId);
        require(msg.value == premium, "Incorrect ETH amount sent");
```

## [[M-04] Vaults steal rebasing tokens' rewards](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cally-findings/issues/50)
_Submitted by IllIllI, also found by horsefacts and smiling_heretic_

Rebasing tokens are tokens that have each holder's `balanceof()` increase over time. Aave aTokens are an example of such tokens.

### Impact

If rebasing tokens are used as the vault token, rewards accrue to the vault and cannot be withdrawn by either the option seller or the owner, and remain locked forever.

### Proof of Concept

The amount 'available' for withdrawal comes from an input parameter and is stored for later operations:

```solidity
File: contracts/src/Cally.sol   #1

173           Vault memory vault = Vault({
174               tokenIdOrAmount: tokenIdOrAmount,
175               token: token,
176               premiumIndex: premiumIndex,
177               durationDays: durationDays,
178               dutchAuctionStartingStrikeIndex: dutchAuctionStartingStrikeIndex,
179               currentExpiration: uint32(block.timestamp),
180               isExercised: false,
181               isWithdrawing: false,
182               tokenType: tokenType,
183               currentStrike: 0,
184               dutchAuctionReserveStrike: dutchAuctionReserveStrike
185           });
186   
187           // vault index should always be odd
188           vaultIndex += 2;
189           vaultId = vaultIndex;
190           _vaults[vaultId] = vault;
191   
192           // give msg.sender vault token
193           _mint(msg.sender, vaultId);
194   
195           emit NewVault(vaultId, msg.sender, token);
196   
197           // transfer the NFTs or ERC20s to the contract
198           vault.tokenType == TokenType.ERC721
199               ? ERC721(vault.token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), vault.tokenIdOrAmount)
200               : ERC20(vault.token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), vault.tokenIdOrAmount);
```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cally/blob/1849f9ee12434038aa80753266ce6a2f2b082c59/contracts/src/Cally.sol#L173-L200>

The amount actually available grows over time and is only known at the time of withdrawal. The option withdrawal/exercise use the original amount:

```solidity
File: contracts/src/Cally.sol   #2

345               : ERC20(vault.token).safeTransfer(msg.sender, vault.tokenIdOrAmount);

```solidity

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Track total amounts currently deposited and allow vault creators to withdraw excess on a pro-rata basis

## [[M-05] Expiration calculation overflows if call option duration ≥ 195 days](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cally-findings/issues/16)
_Submitted by hickuphh3, also found by BondiPestControl, GimelSec, sseefried, and VAD37_

`vault.durationDays` is of type `uint8`, thus allowing a maximum value of 255. `1 days = 86400`, thus fitting into a `uint24`. Solc creates a temporary variable to hold the result of the intermittent multiplication `vault.durationDays * 1 days` using the data type of the larger operand.

In this case, the intermittent data type used would be `uint24`, which has a maximum value of `2**24 - 1 = 16777215`. The maximum number allowable before overflow achieved is therefore `(2**24 - 1) / 86400 = 194`.

### Proof of Concept

Insert this test case into [BuyOption.t.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cally/blob/1849f9ee12434038aa80753266ce6a2f2b082c59/contracts/test/units/BuyOption.t.sol)

```solidity

function testCannotBuyDueToOverflow() public {
  vm.startPrank(babe);
  bayc.mint(babe, 2);
  // duration of 195 days
  vaultId = c.createVault(2, address(bayc), premiumIndex, 195, strikeIndex, 0, Cally.TokenType.ERC721);
  vm.stopPrank();

  vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);
  c.buyOption{value: premium}(vaultId);
}
```

Then run

    forge test --match-contract TestBuyOption --match-test testCannotBuyDueToOverflow

## [[M-06] Owner can set the feeRate to be greater than 100% and cause all future calls to `exercise` to revert](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cally-findings/issues/48)

### Impact

The owner can force options to be non-exercisable, collecting premium without risking the loss of their NFT/tokens

### Proof of Concept

After a buyer buys an option owned by the owner, the owner can change the fee rate to be close to `type(uint256).max`, which will cause the subtraction below to always underflow, preventing the exercise of the option. Once the option expires, the owner can change the fee back and wait for another buyer

```solidity

## [[M-07] Lack of 0 amount check allows malicious user to create infinite vaults](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cally-findings/issues/91)
_Submitted by 0xDjango_

A griefer is able to create as many vaults as they want by simply calling `createVault()` with `tokenIdOrAmount = 0`. This will most likely pose problems on the front-end of the Cally protocol because there will be a ridiculously high number of malicious vaults displayed to actual users.

I define these vaults as malicious because it is possible that a user accidently buys a call on this vault which provides 0 value in return. Overall, the presence of zero-amount vaults is damaging to Cally's product image and functionality.

### Proof of Concept

*   User calls `createVault(0,,,,);` with an ERC20 type.
*   There is no validation that `amount > 0`
*   Function will complete successfully, granting the new vault NFT to the caller.
*   Cally protocol is filled with unwanted 0 amount vaults.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add the simple check `require(tokenIdOrAmount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");`

### Impact

Some ERC20 tokens charge a transaction fee for every transfer (used to encourage staking, add to liquidity pool, pay a fee to contract owner, etc.). If any such token is used in the `createVault()` function, either the token cannot be withdrawn from the contract (due to insufficient token balance), or it could be exploited by other such token holders and the `Cally` contract would lose economic value and some users would be unable to withdraw the underlying asset.

### Proof of Concept

Plenty of ERC20 tokens charge a fee for every transfer (e.g. Safemoon and its forks), in which the amount of token received is less than the amount being sent. When a fee token is used as the `token` in the `createVault()` function, the amount received by the contract would be less than the amount being sent. To be more precise, the increase in the `cally` contract token balance would be less than `vault.tokenIdOrAmount` for such ERC20 token because of the fee.

            vault.tokenType == TokenType.ERC721
                ? ERC721(vault.token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), vault.tokenIdOrAmount)
                : ERC20(vault.token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), vault.tokenIdOrAmount);

The implication is that both the `exercise()` function and the `withdraw()` function are guaranteed to revert if there's no other vault in the contract that contains the same fee tokens, due to insufficient token balance in the `Cally` contract.

When an attacker observes that a vault is being created that contains such fee tokens, the attacker could create a new vault himself that contains the same token, and then withdraw the same amount. Essentially the `Cally` contract would be paying the transfer fee for the attacker because of how the token amount is recorded. This causes loss of user fund and loss of value from the `Cally` contract. It would make economic sense for the attacker when the fee charged by the token accrue to the attacker. The attacker would essentially use the `Cally` contract as a conduit to generate fee income.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Recommend disallowing fee tokens from being used in the vault. This can be done by adding a `require()` statement to check that the amount increase of the `token` balance in the `Cally` contract is equal to the amount being sent by the caller of the `createVault()` function.

### Details & Impact

The `transferFrom()` method is used instead of `safeTransferFrom()`, presumably to save gas. I however argue that this isn’t recommended because:

*   [OpenZeppelin’s documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721-transferFrom-address-address-uint256-) discourages the use of `transferFrom()`, use `safeTransferFrom()` whenever possible
*   Given that any NFT can be used for the call option, there are a few NFTs (here’s an [example](https://github.com/sz-piotr/eth-card-game/blob/master/src/ethereum/contracts/ERC721Market.sol#L20-L31)) that have logic in the `onERC721Received()` function, which is only triggered in the `safeTransferFrom()` function and not in `transferFrom()`

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Call the `safeTransferFrom()` method instead of `transferFrom()` for NFT transfers. Note that the `CallyNft` contract should inherit the `ERC721TokenReceiver` contract as a consequence.

```solidity
abstract contract CallyNft is ERC721("Cally", "CALL"), ERC721TokenReceiver {...}
```

## [[M-10] `createVault()` does not confirm whether `tokenType` and `token`’s type are the same](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cally-findings/issues/243)
_Submitted by GimelSec, also found by antonttc_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cally/blob/main/contracts/src/Cally.sol#L345>

### Impact

When calling `createVault()`, `tokenType` could be different from `token`’s type. If a user accidentally used the wrong `tokenType`, it could lead to two different results.

If `token` is an ERC20 token and the user uses `TokenType.ERC721` as `tokenType`. It is less harmful, since `ERC721(vault.token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), vault.tokenIdOrAmount)` still works when `vault.token` is actually ERC20 token.

However, if `token` is an ERC721 token and the user uses `TokenType.ERC20` as `tokenType`. When doing `creatVault()`, `ERC20(vault.token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), vault.tokenIdOrAmount)` works fine. But when doing `exercise()` or `withdraw()`, `ERC20(vault.token).safeTransfer(msg.sender, vault.tokenIdOrAmount);` doesn’t work since ERC721 doesn’t implement `safeTransfer()` function. In consequence, the ERC721 token is frozen in the vault.

### Proof of Concept

`createVault()` does not confirm whether `tokenType` and `token`’s type are the same.
But the token can still be transferred into this contract. Since `transferFrom()` is implemented in ERC20 and `safeTransferFrom()` is implemented in ERC721

                durationDays: durationDays,
                dutchAuctionStartingStrikeIndex: dutchAuctionStartingStrikeIndex,
                currentExpiration: uint32(block.timestamp),
                isExercised: false,
                isWithdrawing: false,
                tokenType: tokenType,
                currentStrike: 0,
                dutchAuctionReserveStrike: dutchAuctionReserveStrike
            });

            // vault index should always be odd
            vaultIndex += 2;
            vaultId = vaultIndex;
            _vaults[vaultId] = vault;

            // give msg.sender vault token
            _mint(msg.sender, vaultId);

            emit NewVault(vaultId, msg.sender, token);

            // transfer the NFTs or ERC20s to the contract
            vault.tokenType == TokenType.ERC721
                ? ERC721(vault.token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), vault.tokenIdOrAmount)
                : ERC20(vault.token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), vault.tokenIdOrAmount);
        }

However when doing `exercise()` or `withdraw()`, it always reverts since ERC721 doesn’t implement `safeTransfer()`. The ERC721 token is frozen in the contract.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cally/blob/main/contracts/src/Cally.sol#L296>

```
    function exercise(uint256 optionId) external payable {
        …
        // transfer the NFTs or ERC20s to the exerciser
        vault.tokenType == TokenType.ERC721
            ? ERC721(vault.token).transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, vault.tokenIdOrAmount)
            : ERC20(vault.token).safeTransfer(msg.sender, vault.tokenIdOrAmount);
    }

```

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-cally/blob/main/contracts/src/Cally.sol#L345>

```
    function withdraw(uint256 vaultId) external nonReentrant {
        …
        // transfer the NFTs or ERC20s back to the owner
        vault.tokenType == TokenType.ERC721
            ? ERC721(vault.token).transferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, vault.tokenIdOrAmount)
            : ERC20(vault.token).safeTransfer(msg.sender, vault.tokenIdOrAmount);
    }

```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Confirm whether `tokenType` and `token`’s type are the same in `createVault()`.

## [L-01] Wrong error message string in function createVault()

Function : createVault() in Cally.sol

line 169  require(dutchAuctionReserveStrike < strikeOptions[dutchAuctionStartingStrikeIndex], "Reserve strike too small");

### Impact
If the current error message is followed, user will never be able to successfully createVault()


### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Correct error message string
> require(dutchAuctionReserveStrike < strikeOptions[dutchAuctionStartingStrikeIndex], "Reserve strike more than Starting strike");

## [L-02]  Function vaults() can return misleading information
VaultId are odd in number; if a valultId of event number is given, the function valuts() will return misleading information.

Function valuts() in Cally.sol

### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Check if the valutID parameter is of vault type, by adding a require statement

    function vaults(uint256 vaultId) external view returns (Vault memory) {
        require(vaultId % 2 != 0, "Not vault type");
        return _vaults[vaultId];
    }

## [L-03] initiateWithdraw() should not be callable , if option already exercised

If the option is already exercised, the vault owner should not be allowed to call the initiateWithdraw() function.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Add a require statement in the function initiateWithdraw()
>   require(vault.isExercised == false, "Vault already exercised");

## [L-04] Ambiguous error message in createVault() for durationDays

If a value of 0 is given for durationDays in the createVault() function, the transaction will revert with an ambigous message "durationDays too small"
It can better stated as given below

### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Error message string can be changed as below.
> line 170   require(durationDays > 0, "durationDays cannot be zero");


## [L-05] The available values in premiumOptions[] & strikeOptions[] are too restrictive

To reduce gas and storage, the protocol has currently designed to store the index of the premiumOptions[] & strikeOptions[] in the Vault structure.

### Impact
This is too restrictive and may not be future proof.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps
One suggestion is to add another member unit8 premiumMultiplier (with default value of 1) in the Vault struct, and users can have combination of values of the
premiumMultiplier and premiumIndex to define more range of premium values if required.

Same suggestion applies for adding a multiplier for the strikeOptions[]

## [L-06] No event is raised when feeRate is changed

### Impact
When feeRate is changed at setFee(Cally.sol), no event is raised. It would be important to raise this event for any external integration with this system.

### Proof of Concept
Contract : Cally.sol
Function : setFee

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

event definition
```
event FeeRateUpdated(uint256 newFeeRate);
```

event emit at setFee function
```
require(feeRate_ != feeRate, "new feeRate should be different");
feeRate = feeRate_;
emit FeeRateUpdated(feeRate_);
```

## [L-07] No event is raised when vault beneficiary is changed

### Impact
When beneficiary is changed at setVaultBeneficiary(Cally.sol), no event is raised. It would be important to raise this event for any external integration with this system.

### Proof of Concept
Contract : Cally.sol
Function : setVaultBeneficiary

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

event definition
```
event VaultBeneficiaryUpdated(uint256 indexed vaultId, address indexed beneficiary);
```

event emit at setVaultBeneficiary function
```
emit VaultBeneficiaryUpdated(vaultId, beneficiary);
```

## [N-01] Consistency in fetching vault values
In Cally.sol, function buyOption the following is the order of lines.
line 208   require(vaultId % 2 != 0, "Not vault type");
line 211   Vault memory vault = _vaults[vaultId];

This can be made consistent with other functions by changing the order.

  Vault memory vault = _vaults[vaultId];
  require(vaultId % 2 != 0, "Not vault type");


## [N-02] valutIndex = 1 is never used
The value of vaultIndex = 1  is never assigned to any vault.
```
        // vault index should always be odd
        vaultIndex += 2;
        vaultId = vaultIndex;
        _vaults[vaultId] = vault;
```
This can be changed to as below, so that vaultID = 1 is also used
```
        vaultId = vaultIndex;
        // vault index should always be odd
        vaultIndex += 2;
        _vaults[vaultId] = vault;
```

## Summary

| |Issue|Instances|
|-|:-|:-:|
| 1 | Full vault details unnecessarily fetched twice in each call to `buyOption()` | 1 |
| 2 | Re-creation of short `memory` arrays is cheaper than fetching indecies from a storage array | 2 |
| 3 | Use existing stack cache variable rather than re-fetching state variable | 1 |
| 4 | Cheaper to split struct if only part of it is updated frequently | 1 |
| 5 | Store actual beneficiary rather than deciding every time | 2 |
| 6 | Use `unchecked {}` for calculations that cannot overflow | 1 |
| 7 | Also `_burn()` the vault to get a gas refund | 1 |
| 8 | State variables should be cached in stack variables rather than re-reading them from storage | 3 |
| 9 | `<x> += <y>` costs more gas than `<x> = <x> + <y>` for state variables | 2 |
| 10 | `<array>.length` should not be looked up in every loop of a `for`-loop | 1 |
| 11 | `++i`/`i++` should be `unchecked{++i}`/`unchecked{++i}` when it is not possible for them to overflow, as is the case when used in `for`- and `while`-loops | 1 |
| 12 | Offsets should only be calculated once per loop | 1 |
| 13 | Access mappings directly rather than using accessor functions | 5 |
| 14 | Cheaper input valdiations should come before expensive operations | 2 |
| 15 | Not using the named return variables when a function returns, wastes deployment gas | 2 |
| 16 | Use a more recent version of solidity | 1 |
| 17 | Using `> 0` costs more gas than `!= 0` when used on a `uint` in a `require()` statement | 1 |
| 18 | It costs more gas to initialize variables to zero than to let the default of zero be applied | 2 |
| 19 | `++i` costs less gas than `i++`, especially when it's used in `for`-loops (`--i`/`i--` too) | 1 |
| 20 | Usage of `uints`/`ints` smaller than 32 bytes (256 bits) incurs overhead | 10 |
| 21 | Using `private` rather than `public` for constants, saves gas | 1 |

## [G-01] Full vault details unnecessarily fetched twice in each call to `buyOption()`
`getPremium()` should be changed to have its argument be an index into the array, rather than looking up the vault again. Since this is in one of the two frequently-called functions, it'll save a lot of gas

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: contracts/src/Cally.sol   #1

223:         uint256 premium = getPremium(vaultId);
```

## [G-02] Re-creation of short `memory` arrays is cheaper than fetching indecies from a storage array
Since the arrays are relatively short, it's cheaper to have a pure virtual function that [re-creates them every time](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/66388/standard-work-around-for-using-a-solidity-constant-array-which-is-not-supported/96599#96599) just to fetch a specific index, rather than incuring a Gcoldsload (2100 gas). Since this is in one of the two frequently-called functions, it'll save a lot of gas

## [G-03] Use existing stack cache variable rather than re-fetching state variable
Using `auctionStartTimestamp` defined above will save a Gwarmaccess (100 gas). Since this is in one of the two frequently-called functions, it'll save a lot of gas

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: contracts/src/Cally.sol   #1

233:             vault.currentExpiration + AUCTION_DURATION,
```

## [G-04] Cheaper to split struct if only part of it is updated frequently
The `currentStrike` and `currentExpiration` fields are updated frequently so they should be in a separate struct rather than re-writing the whole struct every time

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: contracts/src/Cally.sol   #1

230          // set new currentStrike
231          vault.currentStrike = getDutchAuctionStrike(
232              strikeOptions[vault.dutchAuctionStartingStrikeIndex],
233              vault.currentExpiration + AUCTION_DURATION,
234              vault.dutchAuctionReserveStrike
235          );
236  
237          // set new expiration
238          vault.currentExpiration = uint32(block.timestamp) + (vault.durationDays * 1 days);

240          // update the vault with the new option expiration and strike
241:         _vaults[vaultId] = vault;
```

## [G-05] Store actual beneficiary rather than deciding every time
If the beneficiary array assigns the owner every time the NFT is minted or transferred, the mapping can be used directly, saving the gas overhead of function calls

*There are 2 instances of this issue:*
```solidity
File: contracts/src/Cally.sol   #1

## [G-07] Also `_burn()` the vault to get a gas refund

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*
```solidity

## [G-08] State variables should be cached in stack variables rather than re-reading them from storage
The instances below point to the second+ access of a state variable within a function. Caching will replace each Gwarmaccess (100 gas) with a much cheaper stack read.
Less obvious fixes/optimizations include having local storage variables of mappings within state variable mappings or mappings within state variable structs, having local storage variables of structs within mappings, having local memory caches of state variable structs, or having local caches of state variable contracts/addresses.

## [G-10] `<array>.length` should not be looked up in every loop of a `for`-loop
The overheads outlined below are _PER LOOP_, excluding the first loop
* storage arrays incur a Gwarmaccess (100 gas)
* memory arrays use `MLOAD` (3 gas)
* calldata arrays use `CALLDATALOAD` (3 gas)

Caching the length changes each of these to a `DUP<N>` (3 gas), and gets rid of the extra `DUP<N>` needed to store the stack offset

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: contracts/src/CallyNft.sol   #1

244:          for (uint256 i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
```

## [G-11] `++i`/`i++` should be `unchecked{++i}`/`unchecked{i++}` when it is not possible for them to overflow, as is the case when used in `for`- and `while`-loops
The `unchecked` keyword is new in solidity version 0.8.0, so this only applies to that version or higher, which these instances are. This saves 30-40 gas [_PER LOOP_](https://gist.github.com/hrkrshnn/ee8fabd532058307229d65dcd5836ddc#the-increment-in-for-loop-post-condition-can-be-made-unchecked)

## [G-12] Offsets should only be calculated once per loop
`i * 2` is calculated twice per loop, wasting gas

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*

245              str[2 + i * 2] = alphabet[uint256(uint8(data[i] >> 4))];
246              str[3 + i * 2] = alphabet[uint256(uint8(data[i] & 0x0f))];

## [G-16] Use a more recent version of solidity
Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.0 to get overflow protection without `SafeMath`

Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.2 to get compiler automatic inlining

Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.4 to get custom errors, which are cheaper at deployment than `revert()/require()` strings

Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.10 to have external calls skip contract existence checks if the external call has a return value

## [G-20] Usage of `uints`/`ints` smaller than 32 bytes (256 bits) incurs overhead
> When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contract’s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.

### [G-21] Using `private` rather than `public` for constants, saves gas

## [G-26] Functions guaranteed to revert when called by normal users can be marked `payable`
If a function modifier such as `onlyOwner` is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as `payable` will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided. The extra opcodes avoided are 
`CALLVALUE`(2),`DUP1`(3),`ISZERO`(3),`PUSH2`(3),`JUMPI`(10),`PUSH1`(3),`DUP1`(3),`REVERT`(0),`JUMPDEST`(1),`POP`(2), which costs an average of about 21 gas per call to the function, in addition to the extra deployment cost
