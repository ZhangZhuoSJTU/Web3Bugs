# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 code contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the code contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of Streaming Protocol contest smart contract system written in Solidity. The code contest took place between November 30—December 7 2021.

## [[H-01] Wrong calculation of excess depositToken allows stream creator to retrieve `depositTokenFlashloanFeeAmount`, which may cause fund loss to users](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming-findings/issues/241)
_Submitted by WatchPug, also found by 0x0x0x, ScopeLift, gpersoon, harleythedog, hyh, gzeon, jonah1005, and kenzo_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming/blob/56d81204a00fc949d29ddd277169690318b36821/Streaming/src/Locke.sol#L654-L654>

```solidity
uint256 excess = ERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - (depositTokenAmount - redeemedDepositTokens);
```

In the current implementation, `depositTokenFlashloanFeeAmount` is not excluded when calculating `excess` depositToken. Therefore, the stream creator can call `recoverTokens(depositToken, recipient)` and retrieve `depositTokenFlashloanFeeAmount` if there are any.

As a result:

*   When the protocol `governance` calls `claimFees()` and claim accumulated `depositTokenFlashloanFeeAmount`, it may fail due to insufficient balance of depositToken.
*   Or, part of users' funds (depositToken) will be transferred to the protocol `governance` as fees, causing some users unable to withdraw or can only withdraw part of their deposits.

#### Proof of Concept

Given:

*   `feeEnabled`: true
*   `feePercent`: 10 (0.1%)

1.  Alice deposited `1,000,000` depositToken;
2.  Bob called `flashloan()` and borrowed `1,000,000` depositToken, then repaid `1,001,000`;
3.  Charlie deposited `1,000` depositToken;
4.  After `endDepositLock`, Alice called `claimDepositTokens()` and withdrawn `1,000,000` depositToken;
5.  `streamCreator` called `recoverTokens(depositToken, recipient)` and retrieved `1,000` depositToken `(2,000 - (1,001,000 - 1,000,000))`;
6.  `governance` called `claimFees()` and retrieved another `1,000` depositToken;
7.  Charlie tries to `claimDepositTokens()` but since the current balanceOf depositToken is `0`, the transcation always fails, and Charlie loses all the depositToken.

#### Recommendation

Change to:

```solidity
uint256 excess = ERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - (depositTokenAmount - redeemedDepositTokens) - depositTokenFlashloanFeeAmount;
```

## [[H-02] Tokens can be stolen when `depositToken == rewardToken`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming-findings/issues/215)
_Submitted by cmichel, also found by 0x0x0x, gzeon, Ruhum, gpersoon, hack3r-0m, and pauliax_

The `Streaming` contract allows the `deposit` and `reward` tokens to be the same token.

> I believe this is intended, think Sushi reward on Sushi as is the case with `xSushi`.

The reward and deposit balances are also correctly tracked independently in `depositTokenAmount` and `rewardTokenAmount`.
However, when recovering tokens this leads to issues as the token is recovered twice, once for deposits and another time for rewards:

```solidity
function recoverTokens(address token, address recipient) public lock {
    // NOTE: it is the stream creators responsibility to save
    // tokens on behalf of their users.
    require(msg.sender == streamCreator, "!creator");
    if (token == depositToken) {
        require(block.timestamp > endDepositLock, "time");
        // get the balance of this contract
        // check what isnt claimable by either party
        // @audit-info depositTokenAmount updated on stake/withdraw/exit, redeemedDepositTokens increased on claimDepositTokens
        uint256 excess = ERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - (depositTokenAmount - redeemedDepositTokens);
        // allow saving of the token
        ERC20(token).safeTransfer(recipient, excess);

        emit RecoveredTokens(token, recipient, excess);
        return;
    }
    
    if (token == rewardToken) {
        require(block.timestamp > endRewardLock, "time");
        // check current balance vs internal balance
        //
        // NOTE: if a token rebases, i.e. changes balance out from under us,
        // most of this contract breaks and rugs depositors. this isn't exclusive
        // to this function but this function would in theory allow someone to rug
        // and recover the excess (if it is worth anything)

        // check what isnt claimable by depositors and governance
        // @audit-info rewardTokenAmount increased on fundStream
        uint256 excess = ERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - (rewardTokenAmount + rewardTokenFeeAmount);
        ERC20(token).safeTransfer(recipient, excess);

        emit RecoveredTokens(token, recipient, excess);
        return;
    }
    // ...
```

#### Proof Of Concept

Given `recoverTokens == depositToken`, `Stream` creator calls `recoverTokens(token = depositToken, creator)`.

*   The `token` balance is the sum of deposited tokens (minus reclaimed) plus the reward token amount. `ERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) >= (depositTokenAmount - redeemedDepositTokens) + (rewardTokenAmount + rewardTokenFeeAmount)`
*   `if (token == depositToken)` executes, the `excess` from the deposit amount will be the reward amount (`excess >= rewardTokenAmount + rewardTokenFeeAmount`). This will be transferred.
*   `if (token == rewardToken)` executes, the new token balance is just the deposit token amount now (because the reward token amount has been transferred out in the step before). Therefore, `ERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) >= depositTokenAmount - redeemedDepositTokens`. If this is non-negative, the transaction does not revert and the creator makes a profit.

Example:

*   outstanding redeemable deposit token amount: `depositTokenAmount - redeemedDepositTokens = 1000`
*   funded `rewardTokenAmount` (plus `rewardTokenFeeAmount` fees): `rewardTokenAmount + rewardTokenFeeAmount = 500`

Creator receives `1500 - 1000 = 500` excess deposit and `1000 - 500 = 500` excess reward.

#### Impact

When using the same deposit and reward token, the stream creator can steal tokens from the users who will be unable to withdraw their profit or claim their rewards.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

One needs to be careful with using `.balanceOf` in this special case as it includes both deposit and reward balances.

Add a special case for `recoverTokens` when `token == depositToken == rewardToken` and then the excess should be `ERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - (depositTokenAmount - redeemedDepositTokens) - (rewardTokenAmount + rewardTokenFeeAmount);`

## [[H-03] Reward token not correctly recovered](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming-findings/issues/214)
_Submitted by cmichel, also found by GeekyLumberjack, kenzo, pedroais, and hyh_

The `Streaming` contract allows recovering the reward token by calling `recoverTokens(rewardToken, recipient)`.

However, the excess amount is computed incorrectly as `ERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - (rewardTokenAmount + rewardTokenFeeAmount)`:

```solidity
function recoverTokens(address token, address recipient) public lock {
    if (token == rewardToken) {
        require(block.timestamp > endRewardLock, "time");

        // check what isnt claimable by depositors and governance
        // @audit-issue rewardTokenAmount increased on fundStream, but never decreased! this excess underflows
        uint256 excess = ERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - (rewardTokenAmount + rewardTokenFeeAmount);
        ERC20(token).safeTransfer(recipient, excess);

        emit RecoveredTokens(token, recipient, excess);
        return;
    }
    // ...
```

Note that `rewardTokenAmount` only ever *increases* (when calling `fundStream`) but it never decreases when claiming the rewards through `claimReward`.
However, `claimReward` transfers out the reward token.

Therefore, the `rewardTokenAmount` never tracks the contract's reward balance and the excess cannot be computed that way.

#### Proof Of Concept

Assume no reward fees for simplicity and only a single user staking.

*   Someone funds `1000` reward tokens through `fundStream(1000)`. Then `rewardTokenAmount = 1000`
*   The stream and reward lock period is over, i.e. `block.timestamp > endRewardLock`
*   The user claims their full reward and receives `1000` reward tokens by calling `claimReward()`. The reward contract balance is now `0` but `rewardTokenAmount = 1000`
*   Some fool sends 1000 reward tokens to the contract by accident. These cannot be recovered as the `excess = balance - rewardTokenAmount = 0`

#### Impact

Reward token recovery does not work.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The claimed rewards need to be tracked as well, just like the claimed deposits are tracked.
I think you can even decrease `rewardTokenAmount` in `claimReward` because at this point `rewardTokenAmount` is not used to update the `cumulativeRewardPerToken` anymore.

## [[H-04] Improper implementation of `arbitraryCall()` allows protocol gov to steal funds from users' wallets](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming-findings/issues/258)
_Submitted by WatchPug, also found by Jujic and hack3r-0m_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming/blob/56d81204a00fc949d29ddd277169690318b36821/Streaming/src/Locke.sol#L733-L735>

```solidity
function arbitraryCall(address who, bytes memory data) public lock externallyGoverned {
    // cannot have an active incentive for the callee
    require(incentives[who] == 0, "inc");
    ...
```

When an incentiveToken is claimed after `endStream`, `incentives[who]` will be `0` for that `incentiveToken`.

If the protocol gov is malicious or compromised, they can call `arbitraryCall()` with the address of the incentiveToken as `who` and `transferFrom()` as calldata and steal all the incentiveToken in the victim's wallet balance up to the allowance amount.

#### Proof of Concept

1.  Alice approved `USDC` to the streaming contract;
2.  Alice called `createIncentive()` and added `1,000 USDC` of incentive;
3.  After the stream is done, the stream creator called `claimIncentive()` and claimed `1,000 USDC`;

The compromised protocol gov can call `arbitraryCall()` and steal all the USDC in Alice's wallet balance.

#### Recommendation

Consider adding a mapping: `isIncentiveToken`, setting `isIncentiveToken[incentiveToken] = true` in `createIncentive()`, and `require(!isIncentiveToken[who], ...)` in `arbitraryCall()`.

## [[H-05] Possible incentive theft through the arbitraryCall() function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming-findings/issues/199)
_Submitted by toastedsteaksandwich, also found by Omik, ScopeLift, bitbopper, pedroais, gzeon, Meta0xNull, and wuwe1_

#### Impact

The `Locke.arbitraryCall()` function allows the inherited governance contract to perform arbitrary contract calls within certain constraints. Contract calls to tokens provided as incentives through the createIncentive() function are not allowed if there is some still some balance according to the incentives mapping (See line 735 referenced below).

However, the token can still be called prior any user creating an incentive, so it's possible for the `arbitraryCall()` function to be used to set an allowance on an incentive token before the contract has actually received any of the token through `createIncentive()`.

In summary:

1.  If some possible incentive tokens are known prior to being provided, the `arbitraryCall()` function can be used to pre-approve a token allowance for a malicious recipient.
2.  Once a user calls `createIncentive()` and provides one of the pre-approved tokens, the malicious recipient can call `transferFrom` on the provided incentive token and withdraw the tokens.

#### Proof of Concept

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming/blob/main/Streaming/src/Locke.sol#L735>

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

##### Recommendation 1

Limit the types of incentive tokens so it can be checked that it's not the target contract for the arbitraryCall().

##### Recommendation 2

Validate that the allowance of the target contract (if available) has not changed.

## [[H-06] Creating rewardTokens without streaming depositTokens](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming-findings/issues/166)
_Submitted by bitbopper_

#### Impact

`stake` and `withdraws` can generate rewardTokens without streaming depositTokens.
It does not matter whether the stream is a sale or not.

The following lines can increase the reward balance on a `withdraw` some time after `stake`:
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming/blob/main/Streaming/src/Locke.sol#L219:L222>

    // accumulate reward per token info
    cumulativeRewardPerToken = rewardPerToken();

    // update user rewards
    ts.rewards = earned(ts, cumulativeRewardPerToken);

While the following line can be gamed in order to not stream any tokens (same withdraw tx).

Specifically an attacker can arrange to create a fraction less than zero thereby substracting zero.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming/blob/56d81204a00fc949d29ddd277169690318b36821/Streaming/src/Locke.sol#L229>

    ts.tokens -= uint112(acctTimeDelta * ts.tokens / (endStream - ts.lastUpdate));
    // WARDEN TRANSLATION: (elapsedSecondsSinceStake * stakeAmount) / (endStreamTimestamp - stakeTimestamp)

A succesful attack increases the share of rewardTokens of the attacker.

The attack can be repeated every block increasing the share further.
The attack could be done from multiple EOA increasing the share further.
In short: Attackers can create loss of funds for (honest) stakers.

The economic feasability of the attack depends on:

*   staked amount (times number of attacks) vs total staked amount
*   relative value of rewardToken to gasprice

#### Proof of Concept

##### code

The following was added to `Locke.t.sol` for the `StreamTest` Contract to simulate the attack from one EOA.
```solidity
function test_quickDepositAndWithdraw() public {
    //// SETUP
    // accounting (to proof attack): save the rewardBalance of alice.
    uint StartBalanceA = testTokenA.balanceOf(address(alice));
    uint112 stakeAmount = 10_000;

    // start stream and fill it
    (
        uint32 maxDepositLockDuration,
        uint32 maxRewardLockDuration,
        uint32 maxStreamDuration,
        uint32 minStreamDuration
    ) = defaultStreamFactory.streamParams();

    uint64 nextStream = defaultStreamFactory.currStreamId();
    Stream stream = defaultStreamFactory.createStream(

        address(testTokenB),
        uint32(block.timestamp + 10), 
        maxStreamDuration,
        maxDepositLockDuration,
        0,
        false
        // false,
        // bytes32(0)
    );
    
    testTokenA.approve(address(stream), type(uint256).max);
    stream.fundStream(1_000_000_000);

    // wait till the stream starts
    hevm.warp(block.timestamp + 16);
    hevm.roll(block.number + 1);

    // just interact with contract to fill "lastUpdate" and "ts.lastUpdate" 
// without changing balances inside of Streaming contract
    alice.doStake(stream, address(testTokenB), stakeAmount);
    alice.doWithdraw(stream, stakeAmount);


    ///// ATTACK COMES HERE
    // stake
    alice.doStake(stream, address(testTokenB), stakeAmount);

    // wait a block
    hevm.roll(block.number + 1);
    hevm.warp(block.timestamp + 16);

    // withdraw soon thereafter
    alice.doWithdraw(stream, stakeAmount);

    // finish the stream
    hevm.roll(block.number + 9999);
    hevm.warp(block.timestamp + maxDepositLockDuration);

    // get reward
    alice.doClaimReward(stream);


    // accounting (to proof attack): save the rewardBalance of alice / save balance of stakeToken
    uint EndBalanceA = testTokenA.balanceOf(address(alice));
    uint EndBalanceB = testTokenB.balanceOf(address(alice));

    // Stream returned everything we gave it
    // (doStake sets balance of alice out of thin air => we compare end balance against our (thin air) balance)
    assert(stakeAmount == EndBalanceB);

    // we gained reward token without risk
    assert(StartBalanceA == 0);
    assert(StartBalanceA < EndBalanceA);
    emit log_named_uint("alice gained", EndBalanceA);
}

## [[H-07] Business logic bug in __abdicate() function - 2 Bugs](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming-findings/issues/132)
_Submitted by cyberboy, also found by Meta0xNull_

#### Impact

The `\__abdicate()` function at <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming/blob/main/Streaming/src/Locke.sol#L46-L50> is the logic to remove the governance i.e., to renounce governance. However, the function logic does not consider emergency governor and pending governor, which can be a backdoor as only the "gov" is set to zero address while the emergency and pending gov remains. A pending gov can just claim and become the gov again, replacing the zero address.

#### Proof of Concept

1.  Compile the contract and set the `\_GOVERNOR` and `\_EMERGENCY_GOVERNOR`.
2.  Now set a `pendingGov` but do not call `acceptGov()`

Bug 1
3. Call the `\__abdicate()` function and we will notice only "gov" is set to zero address while emergency gov remains.

Bug2
4. Now use the address used in `pendingGov` to call `acceptGov()` function.
5. We will notice the new gov has been updated to the new address from the zero address.

Hence the `\__abdicate()` functionality can be used as a backdoor using emergency governor or leaving a pending governor to claim later.

#### Tools Used

Remix to test the proof of concept.

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The `\__abdicate()` function should set `emergency_gov` and `pendingGov` as well to zero address.

**[brockelmore (Streaming Protocol) confirmed and disagreed with severity](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming-findings/issues/132#issuecomment-986938323):**

## [[H-08] ts.tokens sometimes calculated incorrectly](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming-findings/issues/123)
_Submitted by gpersoon, also found by WatchPug_

#### Impact

Suppose someone stakes some tokens and then withdraws all of his tokens (he can still withdraw). This will result in ts.tokens being 0.

Now after some time he stakes some tokens again.
At the second stake `updateStream()` is called and the following if condition is false because `ts.tokens==0`

```JS
  if (acctTimeDelta > 0 && ts.tokens > 0) {
```

Thus `ts.lastUpdate` is not updated and stays at the value from the first withdraw.
Now he does a second withdraw. `updateStream()` is called an calculates the updated value of `ts.tokens`.
However it uses `ts.lastUpdate`, which is the time from the first withdraw and not from the second stake. So the value of `ts.token` is calculated incorrectly.
Thus more tokens can be withdrawn than you are supposed to be able to withdraw.

#### Proof of Concept

        ts.lastUpdate = uint32(block.timestamp);
    }
```

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change the code in updateStream()  to:

```JS
if (acctTimeDelta > 0 ) {
    // some time has passed since this user last interacted
    // update ts not yet streamed
    if (ts.tokens > 0) 
            ts.tokens -= uint112(acctTimeDelta * ts.tokens / (endStream - ts.lastUpdate));
    ts.lastUpdate = uint32(block.timestamp);  // always update ts.lastUpdate (if time has elapsed)
}
```

Note: the next if statement with unstreamed and lastUpdate can be changed in a similar way to save some gas

Consider doing arithmetic operations in two steps or upcasting to u256 and then downcasting. Alternatively, find a threshold where it breaks and add require condition to not allow total stake per user greater than threshhold.

## [[H-10] recoverTokens doesn't work when isSale is true](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming-findings/issues/121)
_Submitted by harleythedog, also found by kenzo, pedroais, hyh, and pauliax_

#### Impact

In `recoverTokens`, the logic to calculate the excess number of deposit tokens in the contract is:

    uint256 excess = ERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - (depositTokenAmount - redeemedDepositTokens);

This breaks in the case where isSale is true and the deposit tokens have already been claimed through the use of `creatorClaimSoldTokens`. In this case, `redemeedDepositTokens` will be zero, and `depositTokenAmount` will still be at its original value when the streaming ended. As a result, any attempts to recover deposit tokens from the contract would either revert or send less tokens than should be sent, since the logic above would still think that there are the full amount of deposit tokens in the contract. This breaks the functionality of the function completely in this case.

#### Proof of Concept

See the excess calculation here: <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming/blob/56d81204a00fc949d29ddd277169690318b36821/Streaming/src/Locke.sol#L654>

See `creatorClaimSoldTokens` here: <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming/blob/56d81204a00fc949d29ddd277169690318b36821/Streaming/src/Locke.sol#L583>

Notice that `creatorClaimSoldTokens` does not change `depositTokenAmount` or `redeemedDepositTokens`, so the excess calculation will be incorrect in the case of sales.

#### Tools Used

Inspection

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

I would recommend setting `redeemedDepositTokens` to be `depositTokenAmount` in the function `creatorClaimSoldTokens`, since claiming the sold tokens is like "redeeming" them in a sense. This would fix the logic issue in `recoverTokens`.

# Medium Risk Findings (5)
## [[M-01] LockeERC20 is vulnerable to frontrun attack](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming-findings/issues/55)
_Submitted by egjlmn1, also found by itsmeSTYJ, toastedsteaksandwich, and WatchPug_

#### Impact

A user can steal another user's tokens if he frontrun before he changes the allowance.

The `approve()` function receives an amount to change to.
Lets say user A approved user B to take N tokens, and now he wants to change from N to M, if he calls `approve(M)` the attacker can frontrun, take the N tokens, wait until after the approve transaction, and take another M tokens. And taking N tokens more than the user wanted.

#### Tools Used

Manual code review

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change the approve function to either accept the old amount of allowance and require the current allowance to be equal to that, or change to two different functions that increase and decrease the allowance instead of straight on changing it.

## [[M-02] Any arbitraryCall gathered airdrop can be stolen with recoverTokens](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming-findings/issues/162)
_Submitted by hyh_

#### Impact

Any airdrop gathered with `arbitraryCall` will be immediately lost as an attacker can track `arbitraryCall` transactions and back run them with calls to `recoverTokens`, which doesn't track any tokens besides reward, deposit and incentive tokens, and will give the airdrop away.

#### Proof of Concept

`arbitraryCall` requires that tokens to be gathered shouldn't be reward, deposit or incentive tokens:
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming/blob/main/Streaming/src/Locke.sol#L735>

Also, the function doesn't mark gathered tokens in any way. Thus, the airdrop is freely accessible for anyone to be withdrawn with `recoverTokens`:
<https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming/blob/main/Streaming/src/Locke.sol#L687>

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add airdrop tokens balance mapping, record what is gathered in `arbitraryCall` and prohibit their free withdrawal in `recoverTokens` similarly to incentives\[].

Now:

```solidity
mapping (address => uint112) public incentives;
...
function recoverTokens(address token, address recipient) public lock {
...
		if (incentives[token] > 0) {
			...
			uint256 excess = ERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - incentives[token];
			...
		}

```

To be:
```solidity
mapping (address => uint112) public incentives;
mapping (address => uint112) public airdrops;
...
function recoverTokens(address token, address recipient) public lock {
...
    if (incentives[token] > 0) {
        ...
        uint256 excess = ERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - incentives[token];
        ...
    }
    if (airdrops[token] > 0) {
        ...
        uint256 excess = ERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - airdrops[token];
        ...
    }
...
// we do know what airdrop token will be gathered
function arbitraryCall(address who, bytes memory data, address token) public lock externallyGoverned {
    ...

    // get token balances
    uint256 preDepositTokenBalance = ERC20(depositToken).balanceOf(address(this));
    uint256 preRewardTokenBalance = ERC20(rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this));
    uint256 preAirdropBalance = ERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));

    (bool success, bytes memory _ret) = who.call(data);
    require(success);
    
    uint256 postAirdropBalance = ERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
    require(postAirdropBalance <= type(uint112).max, "air_112");
    uint112 amt = uint112(postAirdropBalance - preAirdropBalance);
    require(amt > 0, "air");
    airdrops[token] += amt;
```

## [[M-03] This protocol doesn't support all fee on transfer tokens](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming-findings/issues/192)
_Submitted by 0x0x0x_

Some fee on transfer tokens, do not reduce the fee directly from the transferred amount, but subtracts it from remaining balance of sender. Some tokens prefer this approach, to make the amount received by the recipient an exact amount. Therefore, after funds are send to users, balance becomes less than it should be. So this contract does not fully support fee on transfer tokens. With such tokens, user funds can get lost after transfers.

#### Mitigation step

I don't recommend directly claiming to support fee on transfer tokens. Current contract only supports them, if they reduce the fee from the transfer amount.

## [[M-04] arbitraryCall() can get blocked by an attacker](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming-findings/issues/47)
_Submitted by GiveMeTestEther, also found by ScopeLift_

#### Impact

`arbitraryCall()`'s (L733) use case is to claim airdrops by "gov". If the address "who" is a token that could be send as an incentive by an attacker via `createIncentive()` then such claim can be made unusable, because on L735 there is a `require(incentives\[who] == 0, "inc");` that reverts if a "who" token was received as an incentive.

In this case the the `incentives\[who]` can be set to 0 by the stream creator by calling `claimIncentive()` but only after the stream has ended according to `require(block.timestamp >= endStream, "stream");` (L520)

If the airdrop is only claimable before the end of the stream, then the airdrop can never be claimed.

If "gov" is not the stream creator then the stream creator must become also the "gov" because `claimIncentive()` only can be called by the stream creator and the `arbitraryCall()` only by "gov". If resetting `incentives\[who]` to 0 by calling `claimIncentive()` and `arbitraryCall()` for the "who" address doesn't happen atomic, an attacker can send between those two calls again a "who" token.

#### Proof of Concept

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

*   Best option at the moment I can think of is to accept the risk but clearly communicate to users that this can happen

 > Yep this is the tradeoff being made. To maintain trustlessness, we cannot remove the `incentives[who] == 0` check. Additionally, governance shouldn't be in charge of an arbitrary stream's `recoverTokens` function. 
> 
> The upshot of this is most `MerkleDrop` contracts are generally external of the token itself and not baked into the ERC20 itself. If a user wants to grief governance, they could continuously `createIncentive` after the stream creator claims the previous. But it does cost the user.



## [[M-05] Storage variable unstreamed can be artificially inflated](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming-findings/issues/118)
_Submitted by harleythedog, also found by csanuragjain, gpersoon, hubble, and WatchPug_

#### Impact

The storage variable `unstreamed` keeps track of the global amount of deposit token in the contract that have not been streamed yet. This variable is a public variable, and users that read this variable likely want to use its value to determine whether or not they want to stake in the stream.

The issue here is that `unstreamed` is incremented on calls to `stake`, but it is not being decremented on calls to `withdraw`. As a result, a malicious user could simply stake, immediately withdraw their staked amount, and they will have increased `unstreamed`. They could do this repeatedly or with large amounts to intentionally inflate `unstreamed` to be as large as they want.

Other users would see this large amount and be deterred to stake in the stream, since they would get very little reward relative to the large amount of unstreamed deposit tokens that *appear* to be in the contract. This benefits the attacker as less users will want to stake in the stream, which leaves more rewards for them.

#### Proof of Concept

See `stake` here: <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming/blob/56d81204a00fc949d29ddd277169690318b36821/Streaming/src/Locke.sol#L417>

See `withdraw` here: <https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-streaming/blob/56d81204a00fc949d29ddd277169690318b36821/Streaming/src/Locke.sol#L455>

Notice that `stake` increments `unstreamed` but `withdraw` does not affect `unstreamed` at all, even though `withdraw` is indeed removing unstreamed deposit tokens from the contract.

#### Tools Used

Inspection

#### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add the following line to `withdraw` to fix this issue:

    unstreamed -= amount;
