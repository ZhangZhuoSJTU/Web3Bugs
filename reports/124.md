# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Notional x Index Coop smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between June 7—June 14 2022.

## Wardens

81 Wardens contributed reports to the Notional x Index Coop:

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 11 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 1 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 10 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 61 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 55 reports recommending gas optimizations.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Notional x Index Coop repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop), and is composed of 5 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 914 lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

## [[H-01] Rounding Issues In Certain Functions](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop-findings/issues/155)
_Submitted by xiaoming90, also found by berndartmueller, GreyArt, jonah1005, kenzo, and minhquanym_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/6f8c325f604e2576e2fe257b6b57892ca181509a/notional-wrapped-fcash/contracts/wfCashERC4626.sol#L52>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/6f8c325f604e2576e2fe257b6b57892ca181509a/notional-wrapped-fcash/contracts/wfCashERC4626.sol#L134>

### Background

Per EIP 4626's Security Considerations (<https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626>)

> Finally, ERC-4626 Vault implementers should be aware of the need for specific, opposing rounding directions across the different mutable and view methods, as it is considered most secure to favor the Vault itself during calculations over its users:
>
> *   If (1) it’s calculating how many shares to issue to a user for a certain amount of the underlying tokens they provide or (2) it’s determining the amount of the underlying tokens to transfer to them for returning a certain amount of shares, it should round *down*.
> *   If (1) it’s calculating the amount of shares a user has to supply to receive a given amount of the underlying tokens or (2) it’s calculating the amount of underlying tokens a user has to provide to receive a certain amount of shares, it should round *up*.

Thus, the result of the `previewMint` and `previewWithdraw` should be rounded up.

### Proof of Concept

The current implementation of `convertToShares` function will round down the number of shares returned due to how solidity handles Integer Division. ERC4626 expects the returned value of `convertToShares` to be rounded down. Thus, this function behaves as expected.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/6f8c325f604e2576e2fe257b6b57892ca181509a/notional-wrapped-fcash/contracts/wfCashERC4626.sol#L52>

```solidity
function convertToShares(uint256 assets) public view override returns (uint256 shares) {
    uint256 supply = totalSupply();
    if (supply == 0) {
        // Scales assets by the value of a single unit of fCash
        uint256 unitfCashValue = _getPresentValue(uint256(Constants.INTERNAL_TOKEN_PRECISION));
        return (assets * uint256(Constants.INTERNAL_TOKEN_PRECISION)) / unitfCashValue;
    }

    return (assets * totalSupply()) / totalAssets();
}
```

ERC 4626 expects the result returned from `previewWithdraw` function to be rounded up. However, within the `previewWithdraw` function, it calls the `convertToShares` function. Recall earlier that the `convertToShares` function returned a rounded down value,  thus `previewWithdraw` will return a rounded down value instead of round up value. Thus, this function does not behave as expected.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/6f8c325f604e2576e2fe257b6b57892ca181509a/notional-wrapped-fcash/contracts/wfCashERC4626.sol#L134>

```solidity
function previewWithdraw(uint256 assets) public view override returns (uint256 shares) {
    if (hasMatured()) {
        shares = convertToShares(assets);
    } else {
        // If withdrawing non-matured assets, we sell them on the market (i.e. borrow)
        (uint16 currencyId, uint40 maturity) = getDecodedID();
        (shares, /* */, /* */) = NotionalV2.getfCashBorrowFromPrincipal(
            currencyId,
            assets,
            maturity,
            0,
            block.timestamp,
            true
        );
    }
}
```

`previewWithdraw` and `previewMint` functions rely on `NotionalV2.getfCashBorrowFromPrincipal` and `NotionalV2.getDepositFromfCashLend` functions. Due to the nature of time-boxed contest, I was unable to verify if `NotionalV2.getfCashBorrowFromPrincipal` and `NotionalV2.getDepositFromfCashLend` functions return a rounded down or up value. If a rounded down value is returned from these functions, `previewWithdraw` and `previewMint` functions would not behave as expected.

### Impact

Other protocols that integrate with Notional's fCash wrapper might wrongly assume that the functions handle rounding as per ERC4626 expectation. Thus, it might cause some intergration problem in the future that can lead to wide range of issues for both parties.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Ensure that the rounding of vault's functions behave as expected. Following are the expected rounding direction for each vault function:

*   previewMint(uint256 shares) - Round Up ⬆

*   previewWithdraw(uint256 assets) - Round Up ⬆

*   previewRedeem(uint256 shares) - Round Down ⬇

*   previewDeposit(uint256 assets) - Round Down ⬇

*   convertToAssets(uint256 shares) - Round Down ⬇

*   convertToShares(uint256 assets) - Round Down ⬇

`previewMint` returns the  amount of assets that would be deposited to mint specific amount of shares. Thus, the amount of assets must be rounded up, so that the vault won't be shortchanged.

`previewWithdraw` returns the amount of shares that would be burned to withdraw specific amount of asset. Thus, the amount of shares must to be rounded up, so that the vault won't be shortchanged.

Following is the OpenZeppelin's vault implementation for rounding reference:

<https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20TokenizedVault.sol>

Alternatively, if such alignment of rounding could not be achieved due to technical limitation, at the minimum, document this limitation in the comment so that the developer performing the integration is aware of this.

> Judging this and all duplicate regarding EIP4626 implementation as High Risk. 

> EIP4626 is aimed to create a consistent and robust implementation patterns for Tokenized Vaults. A slight deviation from 4626 would broke composability and potentially lead to loss of fund (POC in https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop-findings/issues/88 can be an example). It is counterproductive to implement EIP4626 but does not conform to it fully. Especially it does seem that most of the time `deposit` would be successful but not `withdraw`, making it even more dangerous when an immutable consumer application mistakenly used the wfcash contract.

# Medium Risk Findings (10)
## [[M-01] fCash of the wrong maturity and asset can be sent to wrapper address before wrapper is deployed ](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop-findings/issues/115)
_Submitted by 0x52, also found by jonah1005 and unforgiven_

Minting becomes impossible

### Proof of Concept

onERC1155Received is only called when the size of the code deployed at the address contains code. Since create2 is used to deploy the contract, the address can be calculated before the contract is deployed. A malicious actor could send the address fCash of a different maturity or asset before the contract is deployed and since nothing has been deployed, onERC1155Received will not be called and the address will accept the fCash. After the contract is deployed and correct fCash is sent to the address, onERC1155Received will check the length of the assets held by the address and it will be more than 1 (fCash of correct asset and maturity and fCash with wrong maturity or asset sent before deployment). This will cause the contract to always revert essentially breaking the mint completely.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

When the contract is created create a function that reads how many fCash assets are at the address and send them away if they aren't of the correct asset and maturity

## [[M-02] deposit() and mint() and _redeemInternal() in wfCashERC4626() will revert for all fcash that asset token is underlying token because they always call _mintInternal() with useUnderlying==True](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop-findings/issues/82)
_Submitted by unforgiven_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/6f8c325f604e2576e2fe257b6b57892ca181509a/notional-wrapped-fcash/contracts/wfCashERC4626.sol#L177-L184>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/6f8c325f604e2576e2fe257b6b57892ca181509a/notional-wrapped-fcash/contracts/wfCashERC4626.sol#L168-L175>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/6f8c325f604e2576e2fe257b6b57892ca181509a/notional-wrapped-fcash/contracts/wfCashERC4626.sol#L225-L241>

### Impact

For some `fcash` the asset token is underlying token (`asset.tokenType == TokenType.NonMintable`) and `NotionalV2` will not handle minting with `useUnderlying==True` for those `fcash`s (according to what I asked from sponsor). In summery most of the logics in `wfCashERC4626` will not work for those `fcash` tokens.

when for some `fcash` asset token is underlying token, all calls to `NotionalV2` should be with `useUnderlying==False`. but `deposit()` and `mint()` in `wfCashERC4626` contract call `_mintInternal()` with `useUnderlying==True` and it calls `NotionalV2.batchLend()` with `depositUnderlying==true` so the `NotionV2` call will fail for `fcash` tokens that asset token is underlying token and it would cause  that `deposit()` and `mint()`  logic `wfCashERC4626`  will not work and contract will be useless for those tokens.
`_redeemInternal()` issue is similar and it calls `_burn()` with `redeemToUnderlying: true` which execution eventually calls `NotionalV2.batchBalanceAndTradeAction()` with `toUnderlying=True` which will revert so `_redeemInternal()` will fail and because `withdraw()` and `redeem` use it, so they will not work too for those `fcash` tokens that asset token is underlying token.

### Proof of Concept

This is `deposit()` and `mint()`  code in `wfCashERC4626`:

        /** @dev See {IERC4626-deposit} */
        function deposit(uint256 assets, address receiver) public override returns (uint256) {
            uint256 shares = previewDeposit(assets);
            // Will revert if matured
            _mintInternal(assets, _safeUint88(shares), receiver, 0, true);
            emit Deposit(msg.sender, receiver, assets, shares);
            return shares;
        }

        /** @dev See {IERC4626-mint} */
        function mint(uint256 shares, address receiver) public override returns (uint256) {
            uint256 assets = previewMint(shares);
            // Will revert if matured
            _mintInternal(assets, _safeUint88(shares), receiver, 0, true);
            emit Deposit(msg.sender, receiver, assets, shares);
            return assets;
        }

As you can see they both call `_mintInternal()` with last parameter as `true` which is `useUnderlying`'s value. This is `_mintInternal()` code:

        function _mintInternal(
            uint256 depositAmountExternal,
            uint88 fCashAmount,
            address receiver,
            uint32 minImpliedRate,
            bool useUnderlying
        ) internal nonReentrant {
            require(!hasMatured(), "fCash matured");
            (IERC20 token, bool isETH) = getToken(useUnderlying);
            uint256 balanceBefore = isETH ? address(this).balance : token.balanceOf(address(this));

            // If dealing in ETH, we use WETH in the wrapper instead of ETH. NotionalV2 uses
            // ETH natively but due to pull payment requirements for batchLend, it does not support
            // ETH. batchLend only supports ERC20 tokens like cETH or aETH. Since the wrapper is a compatibility
            // layer, it will support WETH so integrators can deal solely in ERC20 tokens. Instead of using
            // "batchLend" we will use "batchBalanceActionWithTrades". The difference is that "batchLend"
            // is more gas efficient (does not require and additional redeem call to asset tokens). If using cETH
            // then everything will proceed via batchLend.
            if (isETH) {
                IERC20((address(WETH))).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), depositAmountExternal);
                WETH.withdraw(depositAmountExternal);

                BalanceActionWithTrades[] memory action = EncodeDecode.encodeLendETHTrade(
                    getCurrencyId(),
                    getMarketIndex(),
                    depositAmountExternal,
                    fCashAmount,
                    minImpliedRate
                );
                // Notional will return any residual ETH as the native token. When we _sendTokensToReceiver those
                // native ETH tokens will be wrapped back to WETH.
                NotionalV2.batchBalanceAndTradeAction{value: depositAmountExternal}(address(this), action);
            } else {
                // Transfers tokens in for lending, Notional will transfer from this contract.
                token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), depositAmountExternal);

                // Executes a lending action on Notional
                BatchLend[] memory action = EncodeDecode.encodeLendTrade(
                    getCurrencyId(),
                    getMarketIndex(),
                    fCashAmount,
                    minImpliedRate,
                    useUnderlying
                );
                NotionalV2.batchLend(address(this), action);
            }

            // Mints ERC20 tokens for the receiver, the false flag denotes that we will not do an
            // operatorAck
            _mint(receiver, fCashAmount, "", "", false);

            _sendTokensToReceiver(token, msg.sender, isETH, balanceBefore);
        }

As you can see it calls `NotionalV2` functions with `useUnderlying=True` but according to sponsor clarification `NotionalV2` would fail and revert for those calls because `useUnderlying=True` and `fcash`'s asset token is underlying token (`asset.tokenType == TokenType.NonMintable`).
So in summery for `fcash` tokens which asset token is underlying token `NotionalV2` won't handle calls which include `useUnderlying==True` but in `wfCashERC4626` contract functions like `deposit()`, `mint()`, `withdraw()` and `redeem()` they all uses `useUnderlying==True` always so `wfCashERC4626` won't work for those specific type of tokens which asset token is underlying token(`asset.tokenType == TokenType.NonMintable`)

the detail explanations for functions `withdraw()` and `redeem()` are similar.

### Tools Used

VIM

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Check that if for that `fcash` token asset token  is underlying token or not and set `useUnderlying` based on that.

## [[M-03] The logic of _isUnderlying() in NotionalTradeModule is wrong which will cause mintFCashPosition() and redeemFCashPosition() revert on `fcash` tokens which asset token is underlying token (asset.tokenType == TokenType.NonMintable)](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop-findings/issues/87)
_Submitted by unforgiven_

For some `fcash` the asset token is underlying token (`asset.tokenType == TokenType.NonMintable`) and `NotionalV2` will not handle minting or burning when it is called with `useUnderlying==True` for those `fcash`s (according to what I asked from sponsor). In summery most of the logics in ` NotionalTradeModule  ` will not work for those `fcash` tokens because `_isUnderlying()` returns `true` result for those tokens which would make `NotionalTradeModule`'s logic for `mintFCashPosition()` and `redeemFCashPosition()` will eventually call `redeemToUnderlying()` and `mintViaUnderlying()` in `wfCashLogic` and those function in `wfCashLogic` will call `NotionalV2` with `useUnderlying==True` and `NotionalV2` will fail and revert for `fcash` tokens which asset token is underlying token, so the whole transaction will fail and `_mintFCashPosition()` and `_redeemFCashPosition()`  logic in ` NotionalTradeModule  ` will not work for those `fcash` tokens and manager can't add them to `set` protocol.

### Proof of Concept

when for some `fcash` asset token is underlying token, all calls to `NotionalV2` should be with `useUnderlying==False`. but `_isUnderlying()` in `NotionalTradeModule` contract first check that `isUnderlying = _paymentToken == underlyingToken` so for `fcash` tokens where asset token is underlying token it is going to return `isUnderlying==True`. let's assume that for some specific `fcash` asset token is underlying token (`asset.tokenType == TokenType.NonMintable`) and follow the code execution.
This is `_isUnderlying()` code in `NotionalTradeModule`:

        function _isUnderlying(
            IWrappedfCashComplete _fCashPosition,
            IERC20 _paymentToken
        )
        internal
        view
        returns(bool isUnderlying)
        {
            (IERC20 underlyingToken, IERC20 assetToken) = _getUnderlyingAndAssetTokens(_fCashPosition);
            isUnderlying = _paymentToken == underlyingToken;
            if(!isUnderlying) {
                require(_paymentToken == assetToken, "Token is neither asset nor underlying token");
            }
        }

As you can see it calls `_getUnderlyingAndAssetTokens()` and then check `_paymentToken == underlyingToken` to see that if payment token is equal to `underlyingToken`. `_getUnderlyingAndAssetTokens()` uses `getUnderlyingToken()` and `getAssetToken()` in `wfCashBase`. This is `getUnderlyingToken()` code in `wfCashBase`:

        /// @notice Returns the token and precision of the token that this token settles
        /// to. For example, fUSDC will return the USDC token address and 1e6. The zero
        /// address will represent ETH.
        function getUnderlyingToken() public view override returns (IERC20 underlyingToken, int256 underlyingPrecision) {
            (Token memory asset, Token memory underlying) = NotionalV2.getCurrency(getCurrencyId());

            if (asset.tokenType == TokenType.NonMintable) {
                // In this case the asset token is the underlying
                return (IERC20(asset.tokenAddress), asset.decimals);
            } else {
                return (IERC20(underlying.tokenAddress), underlying.decimals);
            }
        }

As you can see for our specific `fcash` token this function will return asset token as underlying token. so for this specific `fcash` token, the asset token and underlying token will be same in `_isUnderlying()` of `NationalTradeModule` but because code first check `isUnderlying = _paymentToken == underlyingToken` so the function will return `isUnderlying=True` as a result for our specific `fcash` token (which asset token is underlying token)
This is `_mintFCashPosition()` and `_redeemFCashPosition()` code in ` NotionalTradeModule  `:

        /**
         * @dev Redeem a given fCash position from the specified send token (either underlying or asset token)
         * @dev Alo adjust the components / position of the set token accordingly
         */
        function _mintFCashPosition(
            ISetToken _setToken,
            IWrappedfCashComplete _fCashPosition,
            IERC20 _sendToken,
            uint256 _fCashAmount,
            uint256 _maxSendAmount
        )
        internal
        returns(uint256 sentAmount)
        {
            if(_fCashAmount == 0) return 0;

            bool fromUnderlying = _isUnderlying(_fCashPosition, _sendToken);


            _approve(_setToken, _fCashPosition, _sendToken, _maxSendAmount);

            uint256 preTradeSendTokenBalance = _sendToken.balanceOf(address(_setToken));
            uint256 preTradeReceiveTokenBalance = _fCashPosition.balanceOf(address(_setToken));

            _mint(_setToken, _fCashPosition, _maxSendAmount, _fCashAmount, fromUnderlying);


            (sentAmount,) = _updateSetTokenPositions(
                _setToken,
                address(_sendToken),
                preTradeSendTokenBalance,
                address(_fCashPosition),
                preTradeReceiveTokenBalance
            );

            require(sentAmount <= _maxSendAmount, "Overspent");
            emit FCashMinted(_setToken, _fCashPosition, _sendToken, _fCashAmount, sentAmount);
        }

        /**
         * @dev Redeem a given fCash position for the specified receive token (either underlying or asset token)

        function _redeemFCashPosition(
            ISetToken _setToken,
            IWrappedfCashComplete _fCashPosition,
            IERC20 _receiveToken,
            uint256 _fCashAmount,
            uint256 _minReceiveAmount
        )
        internal
        returns(uint256 receivedAmount)
        {
            if(_fCashAmount == 0) return 0;

            bool toUnderlying = _isUnderlying(_fCashPosition, _receiveToken);
            uint256 preTradeReceiveTokenBalance = _receiveToken.balanceOf(address(_setToken));
            uint256 preTradeSendTokenBalance = _fCashPosition.balanceOf(address(_setToken));

            _redeem(_setToken, _fCashPosition, _fCashAmount, toUnderlying);


            (, receivedAmount) = _updateSetTokenPositions(
                _setToken,
                address(_fCashPosition),
                preTradeSendTokenBalance,
                address(_receiveToken),
                preTradeReceiveTokenBalance
            );


            require(receivedAmount >= _minReceiveAmount, "Not enough received amount");
            emit FCashRedeemed(_setToken, _fCashPosition, _receiveToken, _fCashAmount, receivedAmount);

        }

As you can see they both uses `_isUnderlying()` to find out that if `_sendToken` is asset token or underlying token. for our specific `fcash` token, the result of `_isUnderlying()` will be `True` and `_mintFCashPosition()` and `_redeemFCashPosition()`  will call `_mint()` and `_redeem()` with `toUnderlying` set as `True`. This is `_mint()` and `_redeem()` code:

        /**
         * @dev Invokes the wrappedFCash token's mint function from the setToken
         */
        function _mint(
            ISetToken _setToken,
            IWrappedfCashComplete _fCashPosition,
            uint256 _maxAssetAmount,
            uint256 _fCashAmount,
            bool _fromUnderlying
        )
        internal
        {
            uint32 minImpliedRate = 0;

            bytes4 functionSelector = 
                _fromUnderlying ? _fCashPosition.mintViaUnderlying.selector : _fCashPosition.mintViaAsset.selector;
            bytes memory mintCallData = abi.encodeWithSelector(
                functionSelector,
                _maxAssetAmount,
                uint88(_fCashAmount),
                address(_setToken),
                minImpliedRate,
                _fromUnderlying
            );
            _setToken.invoke(address(_fCashPosition), 0, mintCallData);
        }

        /**
         * @dev Redeems the given amount of fCash token on behalf of the setToken
         */
        function _redeem(
            ISetToken _setToken,
            IWrappedfCashComplete _fCashPosition,
            uint256 _fCashAmount,
            bool _toUnderlying
        )
        internal
        {
            uint32 maxImpliedRate = type(uint32).max;

            bytes4 functionSelector =
                _toUnderlying ? _fCashPosition.redeemToUnderlying.selector : _fCashPosition.redeemToAsset.selector;
            bytes memory redeemCallData = abi.encodeWithSelector(
                functionSelector,
                _fCashAmount,
                address(_setToken),
                maxImpliedRate
            );
            _setToken.invoke(address(_fCashPosition), 0, redeemCallData);
        }

As you can see they are using `_toUnderlying` value to decide calling between (`mintViaUnderlying()` or `mintViaAsset()`) and (`redeemToUnderlying()` or `redeemToAsset()`), for our specific `fcash` `_toUnderlying` will be `True` so those functions will call `mintViaUnderlying()` and `redeemToUnderlying()` in `wfCashLogic`.
`mintViaUnderlying()` and `redeemToUnderlying()` in `wfCashLogic` execution flow eventually would call `NotionalV2` functions with `useUnderlying=True` for this specific `fcash` token, but `NotionalV2` will revert for that call because for that `fcash` token asset token is underlying token and `NotionalV2` can't handle calls with `useUnderlying==True` for that `fcash` Token. This will cause all the transaction to fail and manager can't call `redeemFCashPosition()` or `mintFCashPosition()` functions for those `fcash` tokens that asset token is underlying token.
In summery `NotionalTradeModule` logic will not work for all `fcash` tokens becasue the logic of `_isUnderlying()` is wrong for `fcash` tokens that asset token is underlying token.

### Tools Used

VIM

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Change the logic of `_isUnderlying()` in `NotionalTradeModule` so it returns correct results for all `fcash` tokens. One simple solution can be that it first check `payment token`  value with `asset token` value.

## [[M-04] `IsWrappedFcash` check is a gas bomb](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop-findings/issues/188)
_Submitted by jonah1005_

In the `_isWrappedFCash` check, the `notionalTradeModule` check whether the component is a wrappedCash with the following logic.

```solidity
        try IWrappedfCash(_fCashPosition).getDecodedID() returns(uint16 _currencyId, uint40 _maturity){
            try wrappedfCashFactory.computeAddress(_currencyId, _maturity) returns(address _computedAddress){
                return _fCashPosition == _computedAddress;
            } catch {
                return false;
            }
        } catch {
            return false;
        }
```

The above logic is dangerous when `_fCashPosition` do not revert on `getDecodedID` but instead give a wrong format of return value. The contract would try to decode the return value into `returns(uint16 _currencyId, uint40 _maturity)` and revert. The revert would consume what ever gas it's provided.

[CETH](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4Ddc2D193948926D02f9B1fE9e1daa0718270ED5) is an example.
There's a fallback function in `ceth`

```solidity
    function () external payable {
        requireNoError(mintInternal(msg.value), "mint failed");
    }
```

As a result, calling `getDecodedID` would not revert. Instead, calling `getDecodedID` of `CETH` would consume all remaining gas.
This creates so many issues. First, users would waste too much gas on a regular operation. Second, the transaction might fail if `ceth` is not the last position. Third, the wallet contract can not interact with set token with ceth as it consumes all gas.

### Proof of Concept

The following contract may fail to redeem setTokens as it consumes too much gas (with 20M gas limit).

[Test.sol](https://gist.github.com/Jonah246/fad9e489fe84a6fb8b4894d7377fd8a2)

```solidity
    function test(uint256 _amount) external {
        cToken.approve(address(issueModule), uint256(-1));
        wfCash.approve(address(issueModule), uint256(-1));
        issueModule.issue(setToken, _amount, address(this));
        issueModule.redeem(setToken, _amount, address(this));
    }
```

Also, we can check how much gas it consumes with the following function.

```solidity
    function TestWrappedFCash(address _fCashPosition) public view returns(bool){
        if(!_fCashPosition.isContract()) {
            return false;
        }
        try IWrappedfCash(_fCashPosition).getDecodedID() returns(uint16 _currencyId, uint40 _maturity){
            try wrappedfCashFactory.computeAddress(_currencyId, _maturity) returns(address _computedAddress){
                return _fCashPosition == _computedAddress;
            } catch {
                return false;
            }
        } catch {
            return false;
        }
    }
```

Test this function with `cdai` and `ceth`, we can observe that there's huge difference of gas consumption here.

    Gas used:            30376 of 130376
    Gas used:            19479394 of 19788041

### Tools Used

Hardhat

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

I recommend building a map in the notionalTradeModule and inserting the wrappeCash in the `mintFCashPosition` function.

```solidity
function addWrappedCash(uint16 _currencyId, uint40 _maturity) public {
    address computedAddress = wrappedfCashFactory.computeAddress(_currencyId, _maturity);
    wrappedFCash[computedAddress] = true;
}
```

Or we could replace the try-catch pattern with a low-level function call and check the return value's length before decoding it.

Something like this might be a fix.

```solidity
    (bool success, bytes memory returndata) = target.delegatecall(data);
    if (!success || returndata.length != DECODED_ID_RETURN_LENGTH) {
        return false;
    }
   // abi.decode ....
```

## [[M-05] transferfCash does not work as expected](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop-findings/issues/98)
_Submitted by csanuragjain_

If maturity is reached and user has asked for redeem with opts.transferfCash as true, then if (hasMatured()) turns true at wfCashLogic.sol#L216 causing fcash to be cashed out in underlying token and then sent to receiver. So receiver obtains underlying when fcash was expected. The sender wont get an error thinking fcash transfer was success

### Proof of Concept

1.  User A calls redeem with opts.transferfCash as true and receiver as User B
2.  Since maturity is reached so instead of transferring the fCash, contract would simply cash out fCash and sent the underlying token to the receiver which was not expected

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

If opts.transferfCash is true and maturity is reached then throw an error mentioning that fCash can no longer be transferred

## [[M-06] Users Might Not Be Able To Purchase Or Redeem SetToken](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop-findings/issues/154)
_Submitted by xiaoming90, also found by berndartmueller_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/6f8c325f604e2576e2fe257b6b57892ca181509a/index-coop-notional-trade-module/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/NotionalTradeModule.sol#L309>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/6f8c325f604e2576e2fe257b6b57892ca181509a/index-coop-notional-trade-module/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/NotionalTradeModule.sol#L385>

### Proof of Concept

Whenever a setToken is issued or redeemed, the `moduleIssueHook` and `moduleRedeemHook` will be triggered. These two hooks will in turn call the `_redeemMaturedPositions` function to ensure that no matured fCash positions remain in the Set by redeeming any matured fCash position.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/6f8c325f604e2576e2fe257b6b57892ca181509a/index-coop-notional-trade-module/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/NotionalTradeModule.sol#L309>

```solidity
/**
 * @dev Hook called once before setToken issuance
 * @dev Ensures that no matured fCash positions are in the set when it is issued
 */
function moduleIssueHook(ISetToken _setToken, uint256 /* _setTokenAmount */) external override onlyModule(_setToken) {
    _redeemMaturedPositions(_setToken);
}

/**
 * @dev Hook called once before setToken redemption
 * @dev Ensures that no matured fCash positions are in the set when it is redeemed
 */
function moduleRedeemHook(ISetToken _setToken, uint256 /* _setTokenAmount */) external override onlyModule(_setToken) {
    _redeemMaturedPositions(_setToken);
}
```

The `_redeemMaturedPositions` will loop through all its fCash positions and attempts to redeem any fCash position that has already matured. However, if one of the fCash redemptions fails, it will cause the entire function to revert. If this happens, no one could purchase or redeem the setToken because `moduleIssueHook` and `modileRedeemHook` hooks will revert every single time. Thus, the setToken issuance and redemption will stop working entirely and  this setToken can be considered "bricked".

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/6f8c325f604e2576e2fe257b6b57892ca181509a/index-coop-notional-trade-module/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/NotionalTradeModule.sol#L385>

```solidity
/**
 * @dev Redeem all matured fCash positions for the given SetToken
 */
function _redeemMaturedPositions(ISetToken _setToken)
internal
{
    ISetToken.Position[] memory positions = _setToken.getPositions();
    uint positionsLength = positions.length;

    bool toUnderlying = redeemToUnderlying[_setToken];

    for(uint256 i = 0; i < positionsLength; i++) {
        // Check that the given position is an equity position
        if(positions[i].unit > 0) {
            address component = positions[i].component;
            if(_isWrappedFCash(component)) {
                IWrappedfCashComplete fCashPosition = IWrappedfCashComplete(component);
                if(fCashPosition.hasMatured()) {
                    (IERC20 receiveToken,) = fCashPosition.getToken(toUnderlying);
                    if(address(receiveToken) == ETH_ADDRESS) {
                        receiveToken = weth;
                    }
                    uint256 fCashBalance = fCashPosition.balanceOf(address(_setToken));
                    _redeemFCashPosition(_setToken, fCashPosition, receiveToken, fCashBalance, 0);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Impact

User will not be able to purchase or redeem the setToken. User's fund will be stuck in the SetToken Contract. Unable to remove matured fCash positions from SetToken and update positions of its asset token.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

This is a problem commonly encountered whenever a method of a smart contract calls another contract – you cannot rely on the other contract to work 100% of the time, and it is dangerous to assume that the external call will always be successful.

It is recommended to:

*   Consider alternate method of updating the asset position so that the SetToken's core functions (e.g. issuance and redemption) will not be locked if one of the matured fCash redemptions fails.

*   Evaluate if `_redeemMaturedPositions` really need to be called during SetToken's issuance and redemption. If not, consider removing them from the hooks, so that any issue or revert within `_redeemMaturedPositions` won't cause the SetToken's issuance and redemption functions to stop working entirely.

*   Consider implementing additional function to give manager/user an option to specify a list of matured fCash positions to redeem instead of forcing them to redeem all matured fCash positions at one go.

## [[M-07] Residual Allowance Might Allow Tokens In SetToken To Be Stolen](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop-findings/issues/160)
_Submitted by xiaoming90_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/6f8c325f604e2576e2fe257b6b57892ca181509a/index-coop-notional-trade-module/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/NotionalTradeModule.sol#L418>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/6f8c325f604e2576e2fe257b6b57892ca181509a/index-coop-notional-trade-module/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/NotionalTradeModule.sol#L493>

### Proof of Concept

Whenever `_mintFCashPosition` function is called to mint new fCash position, the contract will call the `_approve` function to set the allowance to `_maxSendAmount` so that the fCash Wrapper contact can pull the payment tokens from the SetToken contract during minting.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/6f8c325f604e2576e2fe257b6b57892ca181509a/index-coop-notional-trade-module/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/NotionalTradeModule.sol#L418>

```solidity
function _mintFCashPosition(
    ISetToken _setToken,
    IWrappedfCashComplete _fCashPosition,
    IERC20 _sendToken,
    uint256 _fCashAmount,
    uint256 _maxSendAmount
)
internal
returns(uint256 sentAmount)
{
    if(_fCashAmount == 0) return 0;
    bool fromUnderlying = _isUnderlying(_fCashPosition, _sendToken); 

    _approve(_setToken, _fCashPosition, _sendToken, _maxSendAmount);

    uint256 preTradeSendTokenBalance = _sendToken.balanceOf(address(_setToken));
    uint256 preTradeReceiveTokenBalance = _fCashPosition.balanceOf(address(_setToken));

    _mint(_setToken, _fCashPosition, _maxSendAmount, _fCashAmount, fromUnderlying)

	..SNIP..
}
```

Note that `_maxSendAmount` is the maximum amount of payment tokens that is allowed to be consumed during minting. This is not the actual amount of payment tokens consumed during the minting process. Thus, after the minting, there will definitely be some residual allowance since it is unlikely that the fCash wrapper contract will consume the exact maximum amount during minting.

The following piece of code shows that having some residual allowance is expected. The `_approve` function will not set the allowance unless there is insufficient allowance.

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/6f8c325f604e2576e2fe257b6b57892ca181509a/index-coop-notional-trade-module/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/NotionalTradeModule.sol#L493>

```solidity
/**
 * @dev Approve the given wrappedFCash instance to spend the setToken's sendToken 
 */
function _approve(
    ISetToken _setToken,
    IWrappedfCashComplete _fCashPosition,
    IERC20 _sendToken,
    uint256 _maxAssetAmount
)
internal
{
    if(IERC20(_sendToken).allowance(address(_setToken), address(_fCashPosition)) < _maxAssetAmount) {
        bytes memory approveCallData = abi.encodeWithSelector(_sendToken.approve.selector, address(_fCashPosition), _maxAssetAmount);
        _setToken.invoke(address(_sendToken), 0, approveCallData);
    }
}
```

### Impact

Having residual allowance increases the risk of the asset tokens being stolen from the SetToken contract. SetToken contract is where all the tokens/assets are held. If the Notional's fCash wrapper contract is compromised, it will allow the compromised fCash wrapper contract to withdraw funds from the SetToken contract due to the residual allowance.

Note that Notional's fCash wrapper contract is not totally immutable, as it is a upgradeable contract. This is an additional risk factor to be considered. If the Notional's deployer account is compromised, the attacker could upgrade the Notional's fCash wrapper contract to a malicious one to withdraw funds from the Index Coop's SetToken contract due to the residual allowance.

Index Coop and Notional are two separate protocols and teams. Thus, it is a good security practice not to place any trust on external party wherever possible to ensure that if one party is compromised, it won't affect the other party. Thus, there should not be any residual allowance that allows Notional's contract to withdraw funds from Index Coop's contract in any circumstance.

In the worst case scenario, a "lazy" manager might simply set the `_maxAssetAmount` to `type(uint256).max`. Thus, this will result in large amount of residual allowance left, and expose the SetToken contract to significant risk.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Approve the allowance on-demand whenever \_`mintFCashPosition` is called, and reset the allowance back to zero after each minting process to eliminate any residual allowance.

```diff
function _mintFCashPosition(
    ISetToken _setToken,
    IWrappedfCashComplete _fCashPosition,
    IERC20 _sendToken,
    uint256 _fCashAmount,
    uint256 _maxSendAmount
)
internal
returns(uint256 sentAmount)
{
    if(_fCashAmount == 0) return 0;
    bool fromUnderlying = _isUnderlying(_fCashPosition, _sendToken); 

    _approve(_setToken, _fCashPosition, _sendToken, _maxSendAmount);

    uint256 preTradeSendTokenBalance = _sendToken.balanceOf(address(_setToken));
    uint256 preTradeReceiveTokenBalance = _fCashPosition.balanceOf(address(_setToken));

    _mint(_setToken, _fCashPosition, _maxSendAmount, _fCashAmount, fromUnderlying)

	..SNIP..
	
+	// Reset the allowance back to zero after minting
+	_approve(_setToken, _fCashPosition, _sendToken, 0);
}
```

Update the `_approve` accordingly to remove the if-statement related to residual allowance.

```diff
function _approve(
    ISetToken _setToken,
    IWrappedfCashComplete _fCashPosition,
    IERC20 _sendToken,
    uint256 _maxAssetAmount
)
internal
{
-    if(IERC20(_sendToken).allowance(address(_setToken), address(_fCashPosition)) < _maxAssetAmount) {
        bytes memory approveCallData = abi.encodeWithSelector(_sendToken.approve.selector, address(_fCashPosition), _maxAssetAmount);
        _setToken.invoke(address(_sendToken), 0, approveCallData);
-    }
}
```

## [[M-08] DOS set token through erc777 hook](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop-findings/issues/168)
_Submitted by jonah1005_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/main/index-coop-notional-trade-module/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/DebtIssuanceModule.sol#L131-L141>

<https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC777/ERC777.sol#L376-L380>

### Impact

The `wfCash` is an `erc777` token. [ERC777.sol#L376-L380](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC777/ERC777.sol#L376-L380) Users can get the control flow before sending token and after receiving tokens. This creates attack vectors that require extra caution in designing modules. Any combination of modules may lead to a possible exploit. To elaborate on the dangerousness of the re-entrancy attack, a possible scenario is presented.

Before the exploit, we first elaborate on three attack vectors:

1.  [DebtIssuanceModule.sol#L131-L141](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/main/index-coop-notional-trade-module/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/DebtIssuanceModule.sol#L131-L141) The issuance module would pull tokens from the sender before minting setToken.

Assume there are three compoenents in this set. 1. CDai. 2. wfCash  In the `_callTokensToSend`, the setToken has received `cdai` and the `totalSupply` is still the same.

2.  `nonReentrant` does not protect cross-contract re-entrancy. This means, that during the `issue` of issuance module, users can trigger other modules' functions.

3.  Restricted functions with `onlyManagerAndValidSet` modifier may be triggered by the exploiter as well. Manager of a setToken is usually a manager contract. Assume it's a multisig-wallet, the exploiter can front-run the execute transaction and replay the payload during his exploit. Note, a private transaction from flash-bot can still be front-run. Please refer to the [uncle bandit risk](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-protect/rpc/uncle-bandits)

Given the above attack vectors, the exploiter have enough weapons to exploit the `setToken` at a propriate time. Note that different combination of modules may have different exploit paths. As long as the above attack vectors remain, the setToken is vulnerable.

Assume a setToken with `CompoundLeverageModule`, `NotionalTradeModule` and `BasicIssuanceModule` with the following positions: 1. CDAI: 100  2. wfCash-DAI 100  and totalSupply = 100. The community decides to remove the `compoundLeverageModule` from the set token. Since `notionalTradeModule` can handle cDAI, the community vote to just call `removeModule` to remove `compoundLeverageModule`. The exploiter has the time to build an exploit and wait the right timing to come.

0.  The exploiter listen the manager multisig wallet.
1.  Exploiter issue 10 setToken.
2.  During the `_callTokensToSend` of `wfcash`, the totalSupply = 100, CDAI = 110, wfCash-DAI = 110.
3.  Call `sync` of `CompoundLeverageModule`. `_getCollateralPosition` get  `_cToken.balanceOf(address(_setToken)) = 110` and `totalSupply = 100` and update the `DefaultUnit` of `CETH` 1,1X.
4.  Replay multisig wallet's payload and remove `compoundLeverageModule`.
5.  The `setToken` can no longer issue / redeem as it would raise `undercollateralized` error. Further, `setValuer` would give a pumped valuation that may cause harm to other protocols.

### Proof of Concept

[POC](https://gist.github.com/Jonah246/13e58b59765c0334189c99a9f29c6dab)
The exploit is quite lengthy. Please check the `Attack.sol` for the main exploit logic.

```solidity
    function register() public {
        _ERC1820_REGISTRY.setInterfaceImplementer(address(this), _TOKENS_SENDER_INTERFACE_HASH, address(this));
        _ERC1820_REGISTRY.setInterfaceImplementer(address(this), _TOKENS_SENDER_INTERFACE_HASH, address(this));
    }

    function attack(uint256 _amount) external {
        cToken.approve(address(issueModule), uint256(-1));
        wfCash.approve(address(issueModule), uint256(-1));
        issueModule.issue(setToken, _amount, address(this));
    }

    function tokensToSend(
        address operator,
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes calldata userData,
        bytes calldata operatorData
    ) external {
        compoundModule.sync(setToken, false);
        manager.removeModule(address(setToken));
    }
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The design choice of wfcash being an `ERC777` seems unnecessary to me. Over the past two years, ERC777 leads to so many exploits. [IMBTC-UNISWAP](https://defirate.com/imbtc-uniswap-hack/) [CREAM-AMP](https://twitter.com/CreamdotFinance/status/1432249771750686721?s=20) I recommend the team use ERC20 instead.

If the SetToken team considers supporting ERC777 necessary, I recommend implementing protocol-wide cross-contract reentrancy prevention. Please refer to Rari-Capital. [Comptroller.sol#L1978-L2002](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/fuse-v1/blob/development/src/core/Comptroller.sol#L1978-L2002)

Note that, `Rari` was [exploited](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/04/30/defi-lender-rari-capitalfei-loses-80m-in-hack/) given this reentrancy prevention. Simply making `nonReentrant` cross-contact prevention may not be enough. I recommend to setToken protocol going through every module and re-consider whether it's re-entrancy safe.

_Submitted by GreyArt, also found by Meera_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/6f8c325f604e2576e2fe257b6b57892ca181509a/index-coop-notional-trade-module/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/NotionalTradeModule.sol#L526>

### Description

If a `_fCashAmount` value that is greater than uint88 is passed into the `_mint` function, downcasting it to uint88 will silently overflow.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

```solidity
// Use a safe downcast function e.g. wfCashLogic::_safeUint88
function _safeUint88(uint256 x) internal pure returns (uint88) {hil
    require(x <= uint256(type(uint88).max));
    return uint88(x);
}

## Codebase Impressions & Summary

Overall, the contracts are very well implemented and the code quality is very high. Protocol developers provided adequate documentation and information on the protocol.

Running the test suite is extensive and covers most of the code, however, a few things stood out:

*   `test_wrapped_fcash.test_transfer_fcash_contract` is skipped
*   many tests are failing on the forked mainnet due to using addresses with insufficient token balances (e.g. `whales.DAI_EOA` has insufficient DAI tokens)
*   the `notionalTradeModule.spec` test suite has many open `TODOs`

## Table of Contents

*   Low Risk
    *   [L-01] Zero-address checks are missing
    *   [L-02] Use of floating pragma
    *   [L-03] Events not emitted for important state changes
    *   [L-04] Matured fCash positions not automatically redeemed in `NotionalTradeModule.initialize`
    *   [L-05] Misleading `NotionalTradeModule._mintFCashPosition` function comments]
    *   [L-06] Misleading comment in `wfCashLogic._burn` function
    *   [L-07] Matured fCash can still be wrapped via `ERC1155` `transfer`
    *   [L-08] Contracts are using outdated OpenZeppelin version `^3.4.2-solc-0.7`
    *   [L-09] `wfCashERC4626` contract does not conform to `EIP4626`
*   Non-Critical Findings
    *   [N-01] Use the `isETH` return value from `wfCashBase.getToken` instead of checking equality with `ETH_ADDRESS`

## [L-01] Zero-address checks are missing

Zero-address checks are a best practice for input validation of critical address parameters. While the codebase applies this to most cases, there are many places where this is missing in constructors and setters.

Impact: Accidental use of zero-addresses may result in exceptions, burn fees/tokens, or force redeployment of contracts.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add zero-address checks, e.g.:

```solidity
require(_weth != address(0), "Zero-address");
```

## [L-02] Use of floating pragma

Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags that they have been tested with thoroughly. Locking the pragma helps to ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example, an outdated compiler version that might introduce bugs that affect the contract system negatively.

<https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-103>

### Findings

[wfCashERC4626.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/6f8c325f604e2576e2fe257b6b57892ca181509a/notional-wrapped-fcash/contracts/wfCashERC4626.sol#L2) `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Lock the pragma version to the same version as used in the other contracts and also consider known bugs (<https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases>) for the compiler version that is chosen.

Pragma statements can be allowed to float when a contract is intended for consumption by other developers, as in the case with contracts in a library or EthPM package. Otherwise, the developer would need to manually update the pragma in order to compile it locally.

## [L-03] Events not emitted for important state changes

When changing state variables events are not emitted. Emitting events allows monitoring activities with off-chain monitoring tools.

### Findings

[NotionalTradeModule.sol#L301](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/6f8c325f604e2576e2fe257b6b57892ca181509a/index-coop-notional-trade-module/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/NotionalTradeModule.sol#L301) `function setRedeemToUnderlying(ISetToken _setToken, bool _toUnderlying)`

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Emit events for state variable changes.

## [L-04] Matured fCash positions not automatically redeemed in `NotionalTradeModule.initialize`

The function comments imply that matured fCash positions are redeemed within `NotionalTradeModule.initialize`. However, this redemption is not implemented in this function.

### Findings

[NotionalTradeModule.sol#L216](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/6f8c325f604e2576e2fe257b6b57892ca181509a/index-coop-notional-trade-module/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/NotionalTradeModule.sol#L216)

```solidity
* Redeem all fCash positions that have reached maturity for their asset token (cToken)
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider calling the function `_redeemMaturedPositions` to redeem matured fCash positions or adapt the function comments.

## [L-05] Misleading `NotionalTradeModule._mintFCashPosition` function comments

The function comments imply that the given fCash position is redeemed. However, this function implements **minting** fCash tokens.

### Findings

[NotionalTradeModule.sol#L415](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/6f8c325f604e2576e2fe257b6b57892ca181509a/index-coop-notional-trade-module/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/NotionalTradeModule.sol#L415)

```solidity
* @dev Redeem a given fCash position from the specified send token (either underlying or asset token)
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Fix the comments to mention minting instead of redeeming.

## [L-06] Misleading comment in `wfCashLogic._burn` function

The comment next to the `_withdrawCashToAccount` function call implies that the `from` address is the withdrawal receiver. However, `opts.receiver` is the receiver.

### Findings

[wfCashLogic.sol#L230](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/6f8c325f604e2576e2fe257b6b57892ca181509a/notional-wrapped-fcash/contracts/wfCashLogic.sol#L230)

```solidity
 // Transfer withdrawn tokens to the `from` address // @audit-info wrong comment - should be `... to the `opts.receiver` address`
  _withdrawCashToAccount(
      currencyId,
      opts.receiver,
      _safeUint88(assetInternalCashClaim),
      opts.redeemToUnderlying
  );
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Fix the comment.

## [L-07] Matured fCash can still be wrapped via `ERC1155` `transfer`

Contrary to the key invariants stated in the [README](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/) (*"After maturity, wrapped fCash can no longer be minted."*), matured fCash can be sent to this `wfCash` contract to receive wrapped fCash tokens in return.

### Findings

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/6f8c325f604e2576e2fe257b6b57892ca181509a/notional-wrapped-fcash/contracts/wfCashLogic.sol#L107-L152>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider adding a check for fCash maturity:

```solidity
require(!hasMatured(), "fCash matured");
```

## [L-08] Contracts are using outdated OpenZeppelin version `^3.4.2-solc-0.7`

Within `notional-wrapped-fcash` `package.json`, an outdated OZ version is used (which has known vulnerabilities, see <https://snyk.io/vuln/npm%3A%40openzeppelin%2Fcontracts>).

However, as `Brownie` is used to install dependencies and compile the contracts, using this outdated version declared in the `package.json` does not impose any risks so far.

Anyway, to prevent any issues in the future (e.g. using solely `hardhat` to compile and deploy the contracts), upgrade the used OZ packages within the `package.json` to the latest versions.

See similar findings:

*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble-findings/issues/81>
*   <https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-02-hubble-findings/issues/81>

### Findings

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/main/notional-wrapped-fcash/package.json#L14>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider using the latest OZ packages within `package.json`.

## [L-09] `wfCashERC4626` contract does not conform to `EIP4626`

The `wfCashERC4626` contract implements the `EIP4626` standard ([EIP-4626: Tokenized Vault Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626)).

However, according to `EIP4626`, the below-mentioned functions do not fully adhere to the specs. They possibly revert due to `require` checks or revert due to external calls reverting.

### Findings

[L47](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/6f8c325f604e2576e2fe257b6b57892ca181509a/notional-wrapped-fcash/contracts/wfCashERC4626.sol#L47) - `function totalAssets() public view override returns (uint256)`

Possibly reverts due to `_getMaturedValue` and `_getPresentValue` reverting.

[L52](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/6f8c325f604e2576e2fe257b6b57892ca181509a/notional-wrapped-fcash/contracts/wfCashERC4626.sol#L52) - `function convertToShares(uint256 assets) public view override returns (uint256 shares)`

Possibly reverts due to `_getPresentValue` and `totalAssets` reverting.

[L64](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/6f8c325f604e2576e2fe257b6b57892ca181509a/notional-wrapped-fcash/contracts/wfCashERC4626.sol#L64) - `function convertToAssets(uint256 shares) public view override returns (uint256 assets)`

Possibly reverts due to `_getPresentValue` and `totalAssets` reverting.

[L85](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/6f8c325f604e2576e2fe257b6b57892ca181509a/notional-wrapped-fcash/contracts/wfCashERC4626.sol#L85) - `function maxWithdraw(address owner) public view override returns (uint256)`

Possibly reverts due to `convertToShares` within `previewWithdraw` reverting.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Given the circumstances, in most of the mentioned cases, it's not possible to implement it without ever reverting. Nevertheless, I want to point out that this contract does not fully conform with the `EIP4626` standard.

## [N-01] Use the `isETH` return value from `wfCashBase.getToken` instead of checking equality with `ETH_ADDRESS`

The `wfCashBase.getToken` returns `bool isETH` which can be used to figure out if the returned token is the native ETH token.

### Findings

[NotionalTradeModule.sol#L400-L403](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-06-notional-coop/blob/6f8c325f604e2576e2fe257b6b57892ca181509a/index-coop-notional-trade-module/contracts/protocol/modules/v1/NotionalTradeModule.sol#L400-L403)

```solidity
(IERC20 receiveToken,) = fCashPosition.getToken(toUnderlying);
if(address(receiveToken) == ETH_ADDRESS) { // @audit-info use returned `isETH` variable from above function instead
    receiveToken = weth;
}
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider using the returned `isETH` variable:

```solidity
(IERC20 receiveToken, bool isETH) = fCashPosition.getToken(toUnderlying);
if(isETH) {
    receiveToken = weth;
}
```

## [1] Avoid contract existence checks by using solidity version 0.8.10 or later

Prior to 0.8.10 the compiler inserted extra code, including `EXTCODESIZE` (**700 gas**), to check for contract existence for external calls. In more recent solidity versions, the compiler will not insert these checks if the external call has a return value

## [2] Multiple accesses of a mapping/array should use a local variable cache

The instances below point to the second+ access of a value inside a mapping/array, within a function. Caching a mapping's value in a local `storage` variable when the value is accessed [multiple times](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ec23a57daa30a8f8ca8b9681c8ccefb0), saves **\~42 gas per access** due to not having to recalculate the key's keccak256 hash (Gkeccak256 - **30 gas**) and that calculation's associated stack operations. Caching an array's struct avoids recalculating the array offsets into memory

## [4] `<array>.length` should not be looked up in every loop of a `for`-loop

The overheads outlined below are *PER LOOP*, excluding the first loop

*   storage arrays incur a Gwarmaccess (**100 gas**)
*   memory arrays use `MLOAD` (**3 gas**)
*   calldata arrays use `CALLDATALOAD` (**3 gas**)

Caching the length changes each of these to a `DUP<N>` (**3 gas**), and gets rid of the extra `DUP<N>` needed to store the stack offset

## [7] Optimize names to save gas

`public`/`external` function names and `public` member variable names can be optimized to save gas. See [this](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/a5d8b486a8259f9f77891a919febd1a9) link for an example of how it works. Below are the interfaces/abstract contracts that can be optimized so that the most frequently-called functions use the least amount of gas possible during method lookup. Method IDs that have two leading zero bytes can save **128 gas** each during deployment, and renaming functions to have lower method IDs will save **22 gas** per call, [per sorted position shifted](https://medium.com/joyso/solidity-how-does-function-name-affect-gas-consumption-in-smart-contract-47d270d8ac92)

## [8] Using `bool`s for storage incurs overhead

```solidity
    // Booleans are more expensive than uint256 or any type that takes up a full
    // word because each write operation emits an extra SLOAD to first read the
    // slot's contents, replace the bits taken up by the boolean, and then write
    // back. This is the compiler's defense against contract upgrades and
    // pointer aliasing, and it cannot be disabled.

Use `uint256(1)` and `uint256(2)` for true/false to avoid a Gwarmaccess (**[100 gas](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/1b70014db712f8572a72378321250058)**) for the extra SLOAD, and to avoid Gsset (**20000 gas**) when changing from 'false' to 'true', after having been 'true' in the past

## [14] Usage of `uints`/`ints` smaller than 32 bytes (256 bits) incurs overhead

> When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contract’s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.

<https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/internals/layout_in_storage.html>
Use a larger size then downcast where needed

## [16] Using `private` rather than `public` for constants, saves gas

If needed, the value can be read from the verified contract source code. Savings are due to the compiler not having to create non-payable getter functions for deployment calldata, and not adding another entry to the method ID table

## [17] Use custom errors rather than `revert()`/`require()` strings to save gas

Custom errors are available from solidity version 0.8.4. Custom errors save [**\~50 gas**](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ad1bd0d29a0101b25e57c293b4b0c746) each time they're hitby [avoiding having to allocate and store the revert string](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/#errors-in-depth). Not defining the strings also save deployment gas

## [18] Functions guaranteed to revert when called by normal users can be marked `payable`

If a function modifier such as `onlyOwner` is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as `payable` will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided. The extra opcodes avoided are
`CALLVALUE`(2),`DUP1`(3),`ISZERO`(3),`PUSH2`(3),`JUMPI`(10),`PUSH1`(3),`DUP1`(3),`REVERT`(0),`JUMPDEST`(1),`POP`(2), which costs an average of about **21 gas per call** to the function, in addition to the extra deployment cost
