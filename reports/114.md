# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the PoolTogether Aave v3 smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between April 29—May 1 2022.

# High Risk Findings (1)
## [[H-01] A malicious early user/attacker can manipulate the vault's `pricePerShare` to take an unfair share of future users' deposits](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-pooltogether-findings/issues/44)
_Submitted by WatchPug, also found by 0xDjango, berndartmueller, CertoraInc, gzeon, kebabsec, leastwood, Tadashi, and unforgiven_

This is a well-known attack vector for new contracts that utilize pricePerShare for accounting.

[AaveV3YieldSource.sol#L352-L374](https://github.com/pooltogether/aave-v3-yield-source/blob/e63d1b0e396a5bce89f093630c282ca1c6627e44/contracts/AaveV3YieldSource.sol#L352-L374)<br>

```solidity
  /**
   * @notice Calculates the number of shares that should be minted or burnt when a user deposit or withdraw.
   * @param _tokens Amount of asset tokens
   * @return Number of shares.
   */
  function _tokenToShares(uint256 _tokens) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 _supply = totalSupply();

    // shares = (tokens * totalShares) / yieldSourceATokenTotalSupply
    return _supply == 0 ? _tokens : _tokens.mul(_supply).div(aToken.balanceOf(address(this)));
  }

  /**
   * @notice Calculates the number of asset tokens a user has in the yield source.
   * @param _shares Amount of shares
   * @return Number of asset tokens.
   */
  function _sharesToToken(uint256 _shares) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 _supply = totalSupply();

    // tokens = (shares * yieldSourceATokenTotalSupply) / totalShares
    return _supply == 0 ? _shares : _shares.mul(aToken.balanceOf(address(this))).div(_supply);
  }
```

A malicious early user can `supplyTokenTo()` with `1 wei` of `_underlyingAssetAddress` token as the first depositor of the `AaveV3YieldSource.sol`, and get `1 wei` of shares token.

Then the attacker can send `10000e18 - 1` of `aToken` and inflate the price per share from 1.0000 to an extreme value of 1.0000e22 ( from `(1 + 10000e18 - 1) / 1`) .

As a result, the future user who deposits `19999e18` will only receive `1 wei` (from `19999e18 * 1 / 10000e18`) of shares token.

They will immediately lose `9999e18` or half of their deposits if they `redeemToken()` right after the `supplyTokenTo()`.

[AaveV3YieldSource.sol#L251-L256](https://github.com/pooltogether/aave-v3-yield-source/blob/e63d1b0e396a5bce89f093630c282ca1c6627e44/contracts/AaveV3YieldSource.sol#L251-L256)<br>

```solidity
  function redeemToken(uint256 _redeemAmount) external override nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
    address _underlyingAssetAddress = _tokenAddress();
    IERC20 _assetToken = IERC20(_underlyingAssetAddress);

    uint256 _shares = _tokenToShares(_redeemAmount);
    _burn(msg.sender, _shares);
    ...
```

Furthermore, after the PPS has been inflated to an extremely high value (`10000e18`), the attacker can also redeem tokens up to `9999e18` for free, (burn `0` shares) due to the precision loss.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider requiring a minimal amount of share tokens to be minted for the first minter, and send a port of the initial mints as a reserve to the DAO address so that the pricePerShare can be more resistant to manipulation.

Also, consder adding `require(_shares > 0, "AaveV3YS/shares-gt-zero");` before `_burn(msg.sender, _shares);`.

# Medium Risk Findings (5)
## [[M-01] User fund loss in `supplyTokenTo()` because of rounding](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-pooltogether-findings/issues/37)
_Submitted by unforgiven, also found by 0x1f8b_

[AaveV3YieldSource.sol#L231-L242](https://github.com/pooltogether/aave-v3-yield-source/blob/e63d1b0e396a5bce89f093630c282ca1c6627e44/contracts/AaveV3YieldSource.sol#L231-L242)<br>
[AaveV3YieldSource.sol#L357-L362](https://github.com/pooltogether/aave-v3-yield-source/blob/e63d1b0e396a5bce89f093630c282ca1c6627e44/contracts/AaveV3YieldSource.sol#L357-L362)<br>

When user use `supplyTokenTo()` to deposit his tokens and get `share` in `FeildSource` because of rounding in division user gets lower amount of `share`. for example if token's `_decimal` was `1` and `totalSupply()` was `1000` and `aToken.balanceOf(FieldSource.address)` was `2100` (becasue of profits in `Aave Pool` `balance` is higher than `supply`), then if user deposit `4` token to the contract with `supplyTokenTo()`, contract is going to `mint` only `1` share for that user and if user calls `YeildToken.balanceOf(user)` the return value is going to be `2` and user already lost half of his deposit.<br>
Of course if ` _precision  ` was high this loss is going to be low enough to ignore but in case of low `_precision` and high price `token` and high `balance / supply` ratio this loss is going to be noticeable.

### Proof of Concept

This is the code of `supplyTokenTo()`:

      function supplyTokenTo(uint256 _depositAmount, address _to) external override nonReentrant {
        uint256 _shares = _tokenToShares(_depositAmount);
        require(_shares > 0, "AaveV3YS/shares-gt-zero");

        address _underlyingAssetAddress = _tokenAddress();
        IERC20(_underlyingAssetAddress).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _depositAmount);
        _pool().supply(_underlyingAssetAddress, _depositAmount, address(this), REFERRAL_CODE);

        _mint(_to, _shares);

        emit SuppliedTokenTo(msg.sender, _shares, _depositAmount, _to);
      }

which in line: `_shares = _tokenToShares(_depositAmount)` trying to calculated `shares` corresponding to the number of tokens supplied. and then transfer `_depositAmount` from user and `mint` shares amount for user.
the problem is that if user convert `_shares` to token, he is going to receive lower amount because in most cases:

    _depositAmount > _sharesToToken(_tokenToShares(_depositAmount))

and that's because of rounding in division. Value of `_shares` is less than \_depositAmount. so `YeildSource` should only take part of `_depositAmount` that equals to `_sharesToToken(_tokenToShares(_depositAmount))` and mint `_share` for user.

Of course if `_precision` was high and `aToken.balanceOf(FieldSource.address) / totalSupply()` was low, then this amount will be insignificant, but for some cases it can be harmful for users. for example this conditions:

*   `_perecision` is low like 1 or 2.
*   `token` value is very high like BTC.
*   `aToken.balanceOf(FieldSource.address) / totalSupply()` is high due to manipulation or profit in `Aave pool`.

### Tools Used

VIM

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

To resolve this issue this can be done:

      function supplyTokenTo(uint256 _depositAmount, address _to) external override nonReentrant {
        uint256 _shares = _tokenToShares(_depositAmount);
        require(_shares > 0, "AaveV3YS/shares-gt-zero");
        
        _depositAmount = _sharesToToken(_shares); // added hero to only take correct amount of user tokens
        address _underlyingAssetAddress = _tokenAddress();
        IERC20(_underlyingAssetAddress).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _depositAmount);
        _pool().supply(_underlyingAssetAddress, _depositAmount, address(this), REFERRAL_CODE);

        _mint(_to, _shares);

        emit SuppliedTokenTo(msg.sender, _shares, _depositAmount, _to);
      }

## [[M-02] `_depositAmount` requires to be updated to contract balance increase](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-pooltogether-findings/issues/8)
_Submitted by MaratCerby, also found by berndartmueller, cccz, CertoraInc, IllIllI, and reassor_

[AaveV3YieldSource.sol#L231-L242](https://github.com/pooltogether/aave-v3-yield-source/blob/e63d1b0e396a5bce89f093630c282ca1c6627e44/contracts/AaveV3YieldSource.sol#L231-L242)<br>

Every time transferFrom or transfer function in ERC20 standard is called there is a possibility that underlying smart contract did not transfer the exact amount entered.<br>
It is required to find out contract balance increase/decrease after the transfer.<br>
This pattern also prevents from re-entrancy attack vector.<br>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Recommended code:<br>
function supplyTokenTo(uint256 \_depositAmount, address \_to) external override nonReentrant {<br>
uint256 \_shares = \_tokenToShares(\_depositAmount);<br>
require(\_shares > 0, "AaveV3YS/shares-gt-zero");<br>

    address _underlyingAssetAddress = _tokenAddress();

    uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(_underlyingAssetAddress).balanceOf(address(this)); // remembering asset balance before the transfer
    IERC20(_underlyingAssetAddress).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _depositAmount);
    _depositAmount = IERC20(_underlyingAssetAddress).balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore; // updating actual amount to the contract balance increase

    _pool().supply(_underlyingAssetAddress, _depositAmount, address(this), REFERRAL_CODE);

    _mint(_to, _shares);

    emit SuppliedTokenTo(msg.sender, _shares, _depositAmount, _to);

}

## [[M-03] Owner or Managers can rug Aave rewards](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-pooltogether-findings/issues/89)
_Submitted by IllIllI, also found by GimelSec_

A malicious owner or manager can steal all Aave rewards that are meant for PoolTogether users.

Even if the user is benevolent the fact that there is a rug vector available may [negatively impact the protocol's reputation](https://twitter.com/RugDocIO/status/1411732108029181960).

### Proof of Concept

```solidity
File: contracts/AaveV3YieldSource.sol   #X

275     function claimRewards(address _to) external onlyManagerOrOwner returns (bool) {
276       require(_to != address(0), "AaveV3YS/payee-not-zero-address");
277   
278       address[] memory _assets = new address[](1);
279       _assets[0] = address(aToken);
280   
281       (address[] memory _rewardsList, uint256[] memory _claimedAmounts) = rewardsController
282         .claimAllRewards(_assets, _to);
```

[AaveV3YieldSource.sol#L275-L282](https://github.com/pooltogether/aave-v3-yield-source/blob/e63d1b0e396a5bce89f093630c282ca1c6627e44/contracts/AaveV3YieldSource.sol#L275-L282)<br>

The `claimRewards()` function allows the caller to send the rewards to an arbitrary address.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Use a `poolAddressesProviderRegistry`-like contract to determine where the rewards should go, instead of letting an address be passed in

**[PierrickGT (PoolTogether) acknowledged and commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-pooltogether-findings/issues/89):**
 > Governance will own this contract with a multisig that will need 7 signatures out of 11 members before a transaction can be sent, so it limits the possibilities of a rug pull.
> These rewards are not tokens deposited by the users, so it's also less of a concern.

## [[M-04] `RewardsController` Emission Manager Can Authorize Users to Claim on Behalf of the `AaveV3YieldSource` Contract and Siphon Yield](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-pooltogether-findings/issues/70)
_Submitted by leastwood_

[aave/RewardsController.sol#L190-L193](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-periphery/blob/master/contracts/rewards/RewardsController.sol#L190-L193)<br>

The `AaveV3YieldSource` contract allows the manager or owner of the contract to claim rewards from  Aave's rewards controller. However, there is an external dependency on this periphery Aave contract such that the emission manager of the `RewardsController` contract may allows other users to be authorized claimers.

Authorized claimers can claim rewards on behalf of the `AaveV3YieldSource` contract, effectively bypassing any restrictions put in place by this proprietary contract and its `claimRewards()` function. A malicious emissions manager can effectively siphon yield away from the `AaveV3YieldSource` contract and redirect it to them-self.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Ensure this is understood and enforce that the `RewardsController` contract is owner by PoolTogether's multisig.

## [[M-05] Yield source does not correctly calculate share conversions](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-pooltogether-findings/issues/86)
_Submitted by IllIllI_

> The aTokens’ value is pegged to the value of the corresponding supplied asset at a 1:1 ratio and can be safely stored, transferred or traded. All yield collected by the aTokens' reserves are distributed to aToken holders directly by continuously increasing their wallet balance.

<https://docs.aave.com/developers/tokens/atoken>

### Impact

Incorrect share conversions lead to incorrect pricing of assets and loss of principal. aTokens are rebasing tokens, which means that holders of the token have their `balanceof()` increase over time, but each token is still redeemable for exactly one underlying asset. Any formula that does not return one out for one in is incorrect.

### Proof of Concept

```solidity
File: contracts/AaveV3YieldSource.sol   #X

352     /**
353      * @notice Calculates the number of shares that should be minted or burnt when a user deposit or withdraw.
354      * @param _tokens Amount of asset tokens
355      * @return Number of shares.
356      */
357     function _tokenToShares(uint256 _tokens) internal view returns (uint256) {
358       uint256 _supply = totalSupply();
359   
360       // shares = (tokens * totalShares) / yieldSourceATokenTotalSupply
361       return _supply == 0 ? _tokens : _tokens.mul(_supply).div(aToken.balanceOf(address(this)));
362     }
363   
364     /**
365      * @notice Calculates the number of asset tokens a user has in the yield source.
366      * @param _shares Amount of shares
367      * @return Number of asset tokens.
368      */
369     function _sharesToToken(uint256 _shares) internal view returns (uint256) {
370       uint256 _supply = totalSupply();
371   
372       // tokens = (shares * yieldSourceATokenTotalSupply) / totalShares
373       return _supply == 0 ? _shares : _shares.mul(aToken.balanceOf(address(this))).div(_supply);
374     }
```

[AaveV3YieldSource.sol#L352-L374](https://github.com/pooltogether/aave-v3-yield-source/blob/e63d1b0e396a5bce89f093630c282ca1c6627e44/contracts/AaveV3YieldSource.sol#L352-L374)<br>

The above code is used for both `supplyTokenTo()` and `redeemToken()` and does not return one for one. Consider the following chain of events:

1.  There are no deposits yet
2.  Alice deposits one wBTC, getting back a AaveV3YieldSource share, while the yield source gets the aToken
3.  Some time later a total of one extra wBTC worth of aToken is generated as yield and is in the `balanceOf(this)`
4.  Alice attempts to withdraw her one share but gets zero wBTC, because `(tokens{1} * totalSupply(){1}) / aToken.balanceOf(this){2}` is zero

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

There does not need to be a conversion function - one share must always equal one token.

## [N-01]

uint256 is assigned to zero by default, additional reassignment to zero is unnecessary
Affected code: [AaveV3YieldSource.sol#L142](https://github.com/pooltogether/aave-v3-yield-source/blob/e63d1b0e396a5bce89f093630c282ca1c6627e44/contracts/AaveV3YieldSource.sol#L142)<br>

### Proof of Concept

<https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/control-structures.html#default-value>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Recommended code:
uint256 private constant ADDRESSES_PROVIDER_ID;

***

## [N-02]

Since solidity v0.8.0 SafeMath library is used by default in arithmetic operations. Using external SafeMath libraries is unnecessary.

Affected code: [AaveV3YieldSource.sol#L361](https://github.com/pooltogether/aave-v3-yield-source/blob/e63d1b0e396a5bce89f093630c282ca1c6627e44/contracts/AaveV3YieldSource.sol#L361)

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Recommended code:
return \_supply == 0 ? \_tokens : (\_tokens \* \_supply) / aToken.balanceOf(address(this));

***

## [N-03]

Since solidity v0.8.0 SafeMath library is used by default in arithmetic operations. Using external SafeMath libraries is unnecessary.

Affected code: [AaveV3YieldSource.sol#L373](https://github.com/pooltogether/aave-v3-yield-source/blob/e63d1b0e396a5bce89f093630c282ca1c6627e44/contracts/AaveV3YieldSource.sol#L373)<br>

**[PierrickGT (PoolTogether) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-pooltogether-findings/issues/12#issuecomment-1115436999):**
 > **[N-01]:** Constant variables need to be initialized, so it is not possible to declare the variable without assigning a value.
> 
> **[N-02] & [N-03]:** SafeMath has been removed in the following PR: https://github.com/pooltogether/aave-v3-yield-source/pull/5
> 
> Great report by this warden that should get extra point for their recommendation to remove SafeMath.

**[Justin Goro (judge) commented](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-04-pooltogether-findings/issues/12#issuecomment-1136490173):**
 > **Severity:** There were two issues reported. Both were non-critical.

## [G-01] State variables only set in the constructor should be declared `immutable`

Avoids a Gsset (20000 gas) in the constructor, and replaces each Gwarmacces (100 gas) with a `PUSH32` (3 gas)

## [G-02] `internal` functions only called once can be inlined to save gas

Not inlining costs 20 to 40 gas because of two extra `JUMP` instructions and additional stack operations needed for function calls.

## [G-04] Usage of `uints`/`ints` smaller than 32 bytes (256 bits) incurs overhead

> When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contract’s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.

<https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/internals/layout_in_storage.html>
Use a larger size then downcast where needed

## [G-08] Functions guaranteed to revert when called by normal users can be marked `payable`

If a function modifier such as `onlyOwner` is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as `payable` will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided. The extra opcodes avoided are<br>
`CALLVALUE`(2),`DUP1`(3),`ISZERO`(3),`PUSH2`(3),`JUMPI`(10),`PUSH1`(3),`DUP1`(3),`REVERT`(0),`JUMPDEST`(1),`POP`(2), which costs an average of about 21 gas per call to the function, in addition to the extra deployment cost

 > > **[G-01] State variables only set in the constructor should be declared immutable**

> PR: https://github.com/pooltogether/aave-v3-yield-source/pull/2
> 
> > **[G-02] internal functions only called once can be inlined to save gas**
> 
> We prefer to keep the internal function `_sharesToToken` since it's a pretty important one with several lines of code in it.

> > **[G-03] Using > 0 costs more gas than != 0 when used on a uint in a require() statement**<br>
> > **[G-05] Don't use SafeMath once the solidity version is 0.8.0 or greater**

> 
> We prefer to cast them first instead to have to downcast them in each functions.
> 
> > **[G-06] require() or revert() statements that check input arguments should be at the top of the function**
> 
> PR: https://github.com/pooltogether/aave-v3-yield-source/pull/12
