# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the LI.FI smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between March 24—March 30 2022.

## Wardens

68 Wardens contributed reports to the LI.FI contest:

# High Risk Findings (2)
## [[H-01] Reliance on `lifiData.receivingAssetId` can cause loss of funds](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance-findings/issues/75)
_Submitted by 0xDjango, also found by hake, kirk-baird, rayn, and shenwilly_

[GenericSwapFacet.sol#L23-L30](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance/blob/699c2305fcfb6fe8862b75b26d1d8a2f46a551e6/src/Facets/GenericSwapFacet.sol#L23-L30)<br>

In the `swapTokensGeneric()` function, an arbitrary number of swaps can be performed from and to various tokens. However, the final balance that is sent to the user relies on `_lifiData.receivingAssetId` which has no use in the swapping functionality. LifiData is claimed to be used purely for analytical reasons per the comments to this function. If this value is input incorrectly, the swapped tokens will simply sit in the contract and be lost to the user.

### Proof of Concept

Imagine a call to `swapTokensGeneric()` with the following parameters (excluding unnecessary parameters for this example):

*   LifiData.receivingAssetId = '0xUSDC_ADDRESS'

Single SwapData array:

*   LibSwap.SwapData.sendingAssetId = '0xWETH_ADDRESS'
*   LibSwap.SwapData.receivingAssetId = '0xDAI_ADDRESS'

Since the `receivingAssetId` from `SwapData` does not match the `receivingAssetId` from `LifiData`, the final funds will not be sent to the user after the swap is complete, based on the following lines of code:

    uint256 receivingAssetIdBalance = LibAsset.getOwnBalance(_lifiData.receivingAssetId);

     _executeSwaps(_lifiData, _swapData);

     uint256 postSwapBalance = LibAsset.getOwnBalance(_lifiData.receivingAssetId) - receivingAssetIdBalance;

     LibAsset.transferAsset(_lifiData.receivingAssetId, payable(msg.sender), postSwapBalance);

Lines 1, 3, and 4 reference `LifiData.receivingAssetId` and handle the transfer of funds following the swaps. Line 2 performs the swap, referencing `SwapData.receivingAssetId` as can be seen in the `executeSwaps()` function definition:

    function _executeSwaps(LiFiData memory _lifiData, LibSwap.SwapData[] calldata _swapData) internal {
            // Swap
            for (uint8 i; i < _swapData.length; i++) {
                require(
                    ls.dexWhitelist[_swapData[i].approveTo] == true && ls.dexWhitelist[_swapData[i].callTo] == true,
                    "Contract call not allowed!"
                );

                LibSwap.swap(_lifiData.transactionId, _swapData[i]);
            }
        }

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

I recommend adding a check that `_lifiData.receivingAssetId` equals the `receivingAssetId` of the last index of the SwapData array, or simply use the `receivingAssetId` of the last index of the SwapData array for sending the final tokens to the user.

## [[H-02] All swapping functions lack checks for returned tokens](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance-findings/issues/76)
_Submitted by 0xDjango, also found by GeekyLumberjack and pmerkleplant_

[GenericSwapFacet.sol#L23-L30](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance/blob/699c2305fcfb6fe8862b75b26d1d8a2f46a551e6/src/Facets/GenericSwapFacet.sol#L23-L30)<br>
[LibSwap.sol#L48](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance/blob/699c2305fcfb6fe8862b75b26d1d8a2f46a551e6/src/Libraries/LibSwap.sol#L48)<br>

Every function that stems from the `GenericSwapFacet` lacks checks to ensure that some tokens have been returned via the swaps. In `LibSwap.sol` in the `swap()` function, the swap call is sent to the target DEX. A return of success is required, otherwise the operation will revert.

Each "inner" swap via `LibSwap.sol` lacks output checks and also the "outer" `swapTokensGeneric()` via `GenericSwapFacet.sol` lacks a final check as well.

There is a possibility that the calldata is accidently populated with a function in the target router that is not actually performing any swapping functionality, `getAmountsOut()` for example. The function will return true, but no new returned tokens will be present in the contract. Meanwhile, the contract has already received the user's `fromTokens` directly.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

This would be a potential use case of using function signature whitelists as opposed to contract address whitelists, as noted as a possibility by the LiFi team.

Otherwise, the following `require` statement in `swapTokensGeneric()` would ensure that at least a single token was received:

`require(LibAsset.getOwnBalance(_swapData.receivingAssetId) - toAmount) > 0, "No tokens received")`

# Medium Risk Findings (13)
## [[M-01] `AnyswapFacet` can be exploited to approve arbitrary tokens.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance-findings/issues/117)
*Submitted by kirk-baird, also found by cccz, dirk\_y, hickuphh3, and rayn*

[AnyswapFacet.sol#L35-L53](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance/blob/main/src/Facets/AnyswapFacet.sol#L35-L53)<br>

In `AnyswapFacet.sol` we parse arbitrary data in `_anyswapData` allowing an attacker to drain funds (ERC20 or native tokens) from the LiFi contract.

Functions effected:

*   `AnyswapFacet.startBridgeTokensViaAnyswap()`
*   `AnyswapFacet.swapAndStartBridgeTokensViaAnyswap()`

### Proof of Concept

This attack works in `AnyswapFacet.startBridgeTokensViaAnyswap()` by having a malicious `_anyswapData.token` which may change the value return in `IAnyswapToken(_anyswapData.token).underlying();`.

First we have the first call to `IAnyswapToken(_anyswapData.token).underlying();` return a malicious ERC20 contract in the attackers control. This allows for transferring these malicious ERC20 tokens to pass the required balance checks.

                uint256 _fromTokenBalance = LibAsset.getOwnBalance(underlyingToken);
                LibAsset.transferFromERC20(underlyingToken, msg.sender, address(this), _anyswapData.amount);

                require(
                    LibAsset.getOwnBalance(underlyingToken) - _fromTokenBalance == _anyswapData.amount,
                    "ERR_INVALID_AMOUNT"
                );

The function will then call `_startBridge()` which again does `address underlyingToken = IAnyswapToken(_anyswapData.token).underlying();` we have the malicious `_anyswapData.token` return a different address, one which the LiFi contract has balance for (a native token or ERC20).

We will therefore execute the following which will either approve or transfer funds to `_anyswapData.router` for a different `underlyingtoken` to the one which supplied the funds to LiFi.

            address underlyingToken = IAnyswapToken(_anyswapData.token).underlying();

            if (underlyingToken == IAnyswapRouter(_anyswapData.router).wNATIVE()) {
                IAnyswapRouter(_anyswapData.router).anySwapOutNative{ value: _anyswapData.amount }(
                    _anyswapData.token,
                    _anyswapData.recipient,
                    _anyswapData.toChainId
                );
                return;
            }

            if (_anyswapData.token != address(0)) {
                // Has underlying token?
                if (underlyingToken != address(0)) {
                    // Give Anyswap approval to bridge tokens
                    LibAsset.approveERC20(IERC20(underlyingToken), _anyswapData.router, _anyswapData.amount);

                    IAnyswapRouter(_anyswapData.router).anySwapOutUnderlying(
                        _anyswapData.token,
                        _anyswapData.recipient,
                        _anyswapData.amount,
                        _anyswapData.toChainId
                    );
                } else {
                    // Give Anyswap approval to bridge tokens
                    LibAsset.approveERC20(IERC20(_anyswapData.token), _anyswapData.router, _anyswapData.amount);

                    IAnyswapRouter(_anyswapData.router).anySwapOut(
                        _anyswapData.token,
                        _anyswapData.recipient,
                        _anyswapData.amount,
                        _anyswapData.toChainId
                    );
                }
            }
        }

Since `_anyswapData.router` is an address in the attackers control they either are transferred native tokens or they have an allowance of ERC20 tokens that they can spend arbitrarily.

The attack is almost identical in `swapAndStartBridgeTokensViaAnyswap()`

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider whitelisting both Anyswap tokens and Anyswap routers (using two distinct whitelists) restricting the attackers ability to use malicious contracts for this attack.

Consider also only calling `IAnyswapToken(_anyswapData.token).underlying()` once and passing this value to `_startBridge()`.

In fact, ~\$300 worth of token is left in the LI.Fi smart contract on ETH mainnet [0x5a9fd7c39a6c488e715437d7b1f3c823d5596ed1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5a9fd7c39a6c488e715437d7b1f3c823d5596ed1) as of block 14597316. I don't think this is High Risk because the max amount lost is no more than allowed slippage, which can be loss to MEV too.

## [[M-02] Anyone can get swaps for free given certain conditions in `swap`.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance-findings/issues/66)
_Submitted by hake, also found by csanuragjain, hickuphh3, hyh, Kenshin, kirk-baird, obront, pmerkleplant, rayn, Ruhum, shw, tintin, VAD37, WatchPug, and wuwe1_

[LibSwap.swap](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance/blob/main/src/Libraries/LibSwap.sol#L29-L48)<br>
[GenericSwapFacet.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance/blob/main/src/Facets/GenericSwapFacet.sol)

Remaining or unaccounted ERC20 balance could be freely taken through `swapTokensGenerics` and `swap`.

### Proof of Concept

    function swap(bytes32 transactionId, SwapData calldata _swapData) internal {
            uint256 fromAmount = _swapData.fromAmount;
            uint256 toAmount = LibAsset.getOwnBalance(_swapData.receivingAssetId);
            address fromAssetId = _swapData.sendingAssetId;
            if (!LibAsset.isNativeAsset(fromAssetId) && LibAsset.getOwnBalance(fromAssetId) < fromAmount) {
                LibAsset.transferFromERC20(fromAssetId, msg.sender, address(this), fromAmount);
            }

            if (!LibAsset.isNativeAsset(fromAssetId)) {
                LibAsset.approveERC20(IERC20(fromAssetId), _swapData.approveTo, fromAmount);
            }

            // solhint-disable-next-line avoid-low-level-calls
            (bool success, bytes memory res) = _swapData.callTo.call{ value: msg.value }(_swapData.callData);
            if (!success) {
                string memory reason = LibUtil.getRevertMsg(res);
                revert(reason);
            }

            toAmount = LibAsset.getOwnBalance(_swapData.receivingAssetId) - toAmount;

Given:

*   There has been a deposit to LiFi of a non-native ERC20 that makes `LibAsset.getOwnBalance(fromAssetId)` a desirable amount.

*   Attacker calls `swapTokensGeneric` with a `_swapData.fromAmount` value just below `LibAsset.getOwnBalance(fromAssetId)`.

*   First `if` statement in `swap` is skipped (no funds are tranferred to LiFis contract).

<!---->

    if (!LibAsset.isNativeAsset(fromAssetId) && LibAsset.getOwnBalance(fromAssetId) < fromAmount) {
                LibAsset.transferFromERC20(fromAssetId, msg.sender, address(this), fromAmount);
            }

*   Swap happens and increases `LibAsset.getOwnBalance(_lifiData.receivingAssetId)`
*   Difference of LiFis balance of the receiving token before and after swap is calculated using `postSwapBalance` and transfered to attacker.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Ensure funds are always subtracted from users account in `swap`, even if LiFi has enough balance to do the swap.

## [[M-03] LibSwap: Excess funds from swaps are not returned](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance-findings/issues/33)
_Submitted by hickuphh3, also found by 0xDjango, cccz, JMukesh, and Ruhum_

[LibSwap.sol#L29-L58](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance/blob/main/src/Libraries/LibSwap.sol#L29-L58)<br>

It is probable for `_swapData.fromAmount` to be greater than the actual amount used (eg. when swapping for an exact output, or when performing another swap after swapping with an exact input). However, these funds aren’t returned back to the user and are left in the lifi contract.

### Proof of Concept

[AnyswapFacet.test.ts#L153-L194](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance/blob/main/test/facets/AnyswapFacet.test.ts#L153-L194)<br>

The test referenced above swaps for MATIC for 1000 USDT exactly. Logging the matic amounts before and after the swap and bridge call, one will find 18.01 MATIC is unused and left in the contract when it should be returned to the user.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Store the contract’s from balance before and after the swap. Refund any excess back to the user.

```jsx
uint256 actualFromAmount = LibAsset.getOwnBalance(fromAssetId);
(bool success, bytes memory res) = _swapData.callTo.call{ value: msg.value }(_swapData.callData);
if (!success) {
  string memory reason = LibUtil.getRevertMsg(res);
  revert(reason);
}
actualFromAmount -= LibAsset.getOwnBalance(fromAssetId);
require(fromAmount >= actualFromAmount, 'actual amount used more than specified');
// transfer excess back to user
if (actualFromAmount != fromAmount) {
  // transfer excess to user
  // difference calculation be unchecked since fromAmount > actualFromAmount
}
```

This comes with the requirement that the funds for every swap should be pulled from the user.

## [[M-04] `msg.value` is Sent Multipletimes When Performing a Swap](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance-findings/issues/86)
_Submitted by kirk-baird, also found by hyh, rayn, TomFrenchBlockchain, VAD37, WatchPug, and wuwe1_

[LibSwap.sol#L42](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance/blob/main/src/Libraries/LibSwap.sol#L42)<br>
[Swapper.sol#L12-L23](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance/blob/main/src/Facets/Swapper.sol#L12-L23)<br>

`msg.value` is attached multiple times to external swap calls in `LibSwap.swap()`.

If `Swapper._executeSwaps()` is called with the native token as the `swapData.fromAssetId` more than once and `msg.value > 0` then more value will be transferred out of the contract than is received since `msg.value` will be transferred out `_swapData.length` times.

The impact is that the contract can have all the native token balance drained by an attacker who has makes repeated swap calls from the native token into any other ERC20 token. Each time the original `msg.value` of the sender will be swapped out of the contract. This attack essentially gives the attacker `_swapData.length * msg.value` worth of native tokens (swapped into another ERC20) when they should only get `msg.value`.

### Proof of Concept

`Swapper._executeSwaps()` iterates over a list of  `SwapData` calling `LibSwap.swap()` each time (note this is an internal call).

```solidity
    function _executeSwaps(LiFiData memory _lifiData, LibSwap.SwapData[] calldata _swapData) internal {
        // Swap
        for (uint8 i; i < _swapData.length; i++) {
            require(
                ls.dexWhitelist[_swapData[i].approveTo] == true && ls.dexWhitelist[_swapData[i].callTo] == true,
                "Contract call not allowed!"
            );

            LibSwap.swap(_lifiData.transactionId, _swapData[i]);
        }
    }
}
```

Inside `LibSwap.swap()` we make an external call to `_swapData.callTo` with `value : msg.value`. Due to the loop in `Swapper._executeSwaps()` this repeatedly sends the original `msg.value` in the external call.

```solidity
        (bool success, bytes memory res) = _swapData.callTo.call{ value: msg.value }(_swapData.callData);
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

This issue may be mitigated by only allowing `fromAssetId` to be the native token once in `_swapData` in `Swapper._executeSwaps()`. If it occurs more than once the transaction should revert.

There can be fund leftover in the contract under normal operation, for example [this tx](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe78c36dd2c2f21cade00a4099701b9c9f82acc8da568e1048a4d7287ce2e45b0). In fact, ~\$300 worth of token is left in the LI.Fi smart contract on ETH mainnet [0x5a9fd7c39a6c488e715437d7b1f3c823d5596ed1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5a9fd7c39a6c488e715437d7b1f3c823d5596ed1) as of block 14597316. I don't think this is High Risk because the max amount lost is no more than allowed slippage, which can be loss to MEV too. Not a duplicate of M-02 since `msg.value` is the vector here.

## [[M-05] cBridge integration fails to send native tokens](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance-findings/issues/35)
_Submitted by hickuphh3, also found by hyh, rayn, shw, WatchPug, and wuwe1_

[CBridgeFacet.sol#L150-L156](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance/blob/main/src/Facets/CBridgeFacet.sol#L150-L156)<br>

The external `sendNative()` call fails to include sending the native tokens together with it.

### Proof of Concept

Add the following test case to the [`CBridgeFacet` test file](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance/blob/main/test/facets/CBridgeFacet.test.ts).

```jsx
// TODO: update bridge address to 0x5427FEFA711Eff984124bFBB1AB6fbf5E3DA1820
it.only('reverts because ETH not sent to bridge', async () => {
  CBridgeData.token = constants.AddressZero
  CBridgeData.amount = constants.One
  await expect(lifi.connect(alice).startBridgeTokensViaCBridge(lifiData, CBridgeData, {
    value: constants.One,
    gasLimit: 500000
  })).to.be.revertedWith('Amount mismatch');
})
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

```jsx
ICBridge(bridge).sendNative{ value: _cBridgeData.amount }(
  _cBridgeData.receiver,
  _cBridgeData.amount,
  _cBridgeData.dstChainId,
  _cBridgeData.nonce,
  _cBridgeData.maxSlippage
);
```

In addition, add the `payable` keyword to the [CBridge interface](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance/blob/main/src/Interfaces/ICBridge.sol#L14-L20).

## [[M-06] DexManagerFacet: batchRemoveDex() removes first dex only](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance-findings/issues/34)
_Submitted by hickuphh3, also found by 0xDjango, catchup, csanuragjain, hyh, shw, WatchPug, and ych18_

[DexManagerFacet.sol#L71-L73](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance/blob/main/src/Facets/DexManagerFacet.sol#L71-L73)<br>

The function intends to allow the removal of multiple dexes approved for swaps. However, the function will only remove the first DEX because `return` is used instead of `break` in the inner for loop.

```jsx
if (s.dexs[j] == _dexs[i]) {
  _removeDex(j);
  // should be replaced with break;
  return;
}
```

This error is likely to have gone unnoticed because no event is emitted when a DEX is added or removed.

### Proof of Concept

Add the following lines below [L44 of](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-Li.finance/blob/main/test/facets/AnyswapFacet.test.ts#L44) `[AnyswapFacet.test.ts](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance/blob/main/test/facets/AnyswapFacet.test.ts#L44)`

```jsx
await dexMgr.addDex(ANYSWAP_ROUTER)
await dexMgr.batchRemoveDex([ANYSWAP_ROUTER, UNISWAP_ADDRESS])
// UNISWAP_ADDRESS remains as approved dex when it should have been removed
console.log(await dexMgr.approvedDexs())
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Replace `return` with `break`.

```jsx
if (s.dexs[j] == _dexs[i]) {
  _removeDex(j);
  break;
}
```

In addition, it is recommend to emit an event whenever a DEX is added or removed.

## [[M-07] ERC20 bridging functions do not revert on non-zero msg.value](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance-findings/issues/53)
_Submitted by hyh, also found by danb, kirk-baird, and pmerkleplant_

Any native funds mistakenly sent along with plain ERC20 bridging calls will be lost. AnyswapFacet, CBridgeFacet, HopFacet and NXTPFacet have this issue.

For instance, swapping function might use native tokens, but the functions whose purpose is bridging solely have no use of native funds, so any mistakenly sent native funds to be frozen on the contract balance.

Placing the severity to be medium as in combination with other issues there is a possibility for user funds to be frozen for an extended period of time (if WithdrawFacet's issue plays out) or even lost (if LibSwap's swap native tokens one also be triggered).

In other words, the vulnerability is also a wider attack surface enabler as it can bring in the user funds to the contract balance.

Medium despite the fund loss possibility as the native funds in question here are mistakenly sent only, so the probability is lower compared to direct leakage issues.

### Proof of Concept

startBridgeTokensViaAnyswap doesn't check that `msg.value` is zero:

[AnyswapFacet.sol#L38-L48](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance/blob/main/src/Facets/AnyswapFacet.sol#L38-L48)<br>

startBridgeTokensViaCBridge also have no such check:

[CBridgeFacet.sol#L59-L66](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance/blob/main/src/Facets/CBridgeFacet.sol#L59-L66)<br>

startBridgeTokensViaHop the same:

[HopFacet.sol#L66-L71](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance/blob/main/src/Facets/HopFacet.sol#L66-L71)<br>

In NXTPFacet completion function does the check, but startBridgeTokensViaNXTP doesn't:

[NXTPFacet.sol#L54-L59](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance/blob/main/src/Facets/NXTPFacet.sol#L54-L59)<br>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider reverting when bridging functions with non-native target are called with non-zero native amount added.

There is a reenterancy vulnerability in functions which call `Swapper._executeSwap()` which would allow the attacker to change their `postSwapBalance`.

The functions following similar logic to that seen in `GenericSwapFacet.swapTokensGeneric()`.

            uint256 receivingAssetIdBalance = LibAsset.getOwnBalance(_lifiData.receivingAssetId);

            // Swap
            _executeSwaps(_lifiData, _swapData);

            uint256 postSwapBalance = LibAsset.getOwnBalance(_lifiData.receivingAssetId) - receivingAssetIdBalance;

            LibAsset.transferAsset(_lifiData.receivingAssetId, payable(msg.sender), postSwapBalance);

This logic records the balance before and after the `_executeSwaps()` function. The difference is then transferred to the `msg.sender`.

The issue occurs since it is possible for an attacker to reenter this function during `_executeSwaps()`, that is because execute swap makes numerous external calls, such as to the AMM, or to untrusted ERC20 token addresses.

If a function is called such as `WithdrawFacet.withdraw()` this will impact the calculations of `postSwapBalance` which will account for the funds transferred out during withdrawal. Furthermore, any functions which transfers funds into the contract will also be counted in the `postSwapBalance` calculations.

Vulnerable Functions:

*   `GenericSwapFacet.swapTokensGeneric()`
*   `CBridgeFacet.swapAndStartBridgeTokensViaCBridge()`
*   `AnyswapFacet.swapAndStartBridgeTokensViaAnyswap()`
*   `HopFacet.swapAndStartBridgeTokensViaHop()`

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider adding a reentrancy guard over **every** function which may send or receive tokens. It may be easiest too add this guard over the `fallback()` function however that could prevent view functions from being called (since it would perform storage operations).

Ensure the same slot is used to store the reentrancy guard so all required functions are covered by a single guard.

## [[M-09] Should prevent users from sending more native tokens in the `startBridgeTokensViaCBridge` function](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance-findings/issues/207)

When a user bridges a native token via the `startBridgeTokensViaCBridge` function of `CBridgeFacet`, the contract checks whether `msg.value >= _cBridgeData.amount` holds. In other words, if a user accidentally sends more native tokens than he has to, the contract accepts it but only bridges the `_cBridgeData.amount` amount of tokens. The rest of the tokens are left in the contract and can be recovered by anyone (see another submission for details).

Notice that in the similar functions of other facets (e.g., `AnyswapFacet`, `HopFacet`), the provided native token is ensured to be the exact bridged amount, which effectively prevents the above scenario of loss of funds.

### Proof of Concept

[CBridgeFacet.sol#L68](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance/blob/main/src/Facets/CBridgeFacet.sol#L68)

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider changing `>=` to `==` at line 68.

```

[LibAsset.sol#L59-L70](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance/blob/699c2305fcfb6fe8862b75b26d1d8a2f46a551e6/src/Libraries/LibAsset.sol#L59-L70)<br>

        SafeERC20.safeApprove(IERC20(assetId), spender, MAX_INT);
    }
}
```

In the `AnyswapFacet.sol`, `_anyswapData.router` is from the caller's calldata, which can really be any contract, including a fake Anyswap router contract, as long as it complies to the interfaces used.

And in `_startBridge`, it will grant infinite approval for the `_anyswapData.token` to the `_anyswapData.router`.

This makes it possible for a attacker to steal all the funds from the contract.

Which we explained in [#159](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance-findings/issues/159), the diamond contract may be holding some funds for various of reasons.

### Proof of Concept

Given:

There are 100 USDC tokens in the contract.

1.  The attacker can submit a `startBridgeTokensViaAnyswap()` with a FAKE `_anyswapData.router`.
2.  Once the FAKE router contract deployed by the attacker got the infinite approval from the diamond contract, the attacker can call `transferFrom()` and take all the funds, including the 100 USDC in the contract anytime.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

1.  Whitelisting the `_anyswapData.router` rather than trusting user's inputs;
2.  Or, only `approve()` for the amount that required for the current transaction instead of infinite approval.

I don't think this is High Risk because the max amount lost is no more than allowed slippage, which can be loss to MEV too.

## [[M-11] Failed transfer with low level call won't revert](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance-findings/issues/101)
_Submitted by GeekyLumberjack, also found by CertoraInc_

[LibSwap.sol#L42-L46](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance/blob/main/src/Libraries/LibSwap.sol#L42-L46)<br>

`swap` is used throughout the code via `_executeSwaps` in Swapper.sol. According to [Solidity Docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-require-revert-and-exceptions) the call may return true even if it was a failure. This may result in user funds lost because funds were transferred into this contract in preparation for the swap. The swap fails but doesn't revert. There is a way this can happen through GenericSwapFacet.sol due to a missing require that is present in the other facets which is a separate issue but gives this issue more relevance.

### Proof of Concept

1.  Alice uses Generic swap with 100 DAI
2.  Alice's 100 DAI are sent to the Swapper.sol contract
3.  The call on swap `_swapData.callTo.call{ value: msg.value }(_swapData.callData);` fails but returns success due to nonexisting contract
4.  postSwapBalance = 0
5.  Alice receives nothing in return

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Check for contract existence.

## [[M-13] WithdrawFacet's `withdraw` calls native `payable.transfer`, which can be unusable for DiamondStorage owner contract](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance-findings/issues/14)
_Submitted by hyh, also found by Dravee, JMukesh, Jujic, peritoflores, shw, sorrynotsorry, and wuwe1_

When `withdraw` function is used with native token it is being handled with a `payable.transfer()` call.

This is unsafe as `transfer` has hard coded gas budget and can fail when the user is a smart contract. This way any programmatical usage of WithdrawFacet is at risk. Whenever the user either fails to implement the payable fallback function or cumulative gas cost of the function sequence invoked on a native token transfer exceeds 2300 gas consumption limit the native tokens sent end up undelivered and the corresponding user funds return functionality will fail each time.

WithdrawFacet is a core helper contracts that provides basic withdraw functionality to the system, and this way the impact includes principal funds freeze scenario if the described aspect be violated in the DiamondStorage.contractOwner code.

Marking the issue as a medium severity as this is a fund freeze case, but limited to the incorrect contractOwner implementation.

### Proof of Concept

When WithdrawFacet's `withdraw` is called with `_assetAddress` being equal to `NATIVE_ASSET`, the native transfer is handled with `payable.transfer()` mechanics:

[WithdrawFacet.sol#L28-L31](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance/blob/main/src/Facets/WithdrawFacet.sol#L28-L31)<br>

WithdrawFacet is a part of EIP-2535 setup:

[Li.Fi Diamond Helper Contracts](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance#diamond-helper-contracts)<br>

### References

The issues with `transfer()` are outlined here:

[Stop Using Solidity's transfer() Now](https://consensys.net/diligence/blog/2019/09/stop-using-soliditys-transfer-now/)

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

As `withdraw` is runnable by the DiamondStorage.contractOwner only the reentrancy isn't an issue and `transfer()` can be just replaced.

Using low-level `call.value(amount)` with the corresponding result check or using the OpenZeppelin's `Address.sendValue` is advised:

## [L-01] `initNXTP` can be initialized multiple times.

[L33-37](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance/blob/main/src/Facets/NXTPFacet.sol#L33-L37)

    function initNXTP(ITransactionManager _txMgrAddr) external {
            Storage storage s = getStorage();
            LibDiamond.enforceIsContractOwner();
            s.nxtpTxManager = _txMgrAddr;
        }

The function `initNXTP` has init in its name, suggesting that it should only be called once to intiliaze the `nxtpTxManager`. However, it can be called multiple times to overwrite the address.

Recommend setting the address in a `constructor` or reverting if address is already set. Third option would be changing the name from `initNXTP` to something like `setNXTP` to better align function names with their functionality.

Note: Same issue is present in `initHop` and `initCbridge`.

## [L-02] No zero value checks for both `_nxtpData.amount` and `msg.value` in `startBridgeTokensViaNXTP`.

[L46-60](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance/blob/main/src/Facets/NXTPFacet.sol#L46-L60)

    function startBridgeTokensViaNXTP(LiFiData memory _lifiData, ITransactionManager.PrepareArgs memory _nxtpData)
            public
            payable
        {
            // Ensure sender has enough to complete the bridge transaction
            address sendingAssetId = _nxtpData.invariantData.sendingAssetId;
            if (sendingAssetId == address(0)) require(msg.value == _nxtpData.amount, "ERR_INVALID_AMOUNT");
            else {
                uint256 _sendingAssetIdBalance = LibAsset.getOwnBalance(sendingAssetId);
                LibAsset.transferFromERC20(sendingAssetId, msg.sender, address(this), _nxtpData.amount);
                require(
                    LibAsset.getOwnBalance(sendingAssetId) - _sendingAssetIdBalance == _nxtpData.amount,
                    "ERR_INVALID_AMOUNT"
                );
            }

Lack of zero value check on both `_nxtpData.amount` and `msg.value` allow bridge to be wastefully started.

Recommend implementing a `require` function such as(line 50):

    require(msg.value > 0 || _nxtpData.amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than zero!");

## [L-03] No zero address check for adding DEX contract in `addDex`, `batchAddDex`, `removeDex` and `batchRemoveDex`.

[addDex](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance/blob/main/src/Facets/DexManagerFacet.sol#L17-L22)

Zero address check would prevent adding harmful DEX contracts by mistake. If zero address DEXs are whitelisted, users could burn their tokens on accident.

## [L-04] Unchecked `transfer` in `WithdrawFacet.sol`

[WithdrawFacet.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance/blob/main/src/Facets/WithdrawFacet.sol#L20-L36)

Boolean return value for `transfer` is not checked.

    assert(_amount <= self.balance);
                payable(sendTo).transfer(_amount);
            } else {

I recommend implementing `call` instead:

    (bool success, ) = sendTo.call.value(_amount)("");
    require(success, "Transfer failed.");

## [N-01] `initNXTP` and `initHop` emit no event.

[NXTPFacet.sol: L33-37](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance/blob/main/src/Facets/NXTPFacet.sol#L33-L37)<br>
[HopFacet.sol: L40-52](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance/blob/main/src/Facets/HopFacet.sol#L40-L52)<br>

Emitting an event with the initialization of `nxtpTxManager` and `initHop` can increase the protocols transparency and trust. `CbridgeFacet.initCbridge` emits an event, so keeping it consistent is also good practice.

## [N-02] Minor typo in comment in line 31. Conatains - Contains.

[L31](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance/blob/main/src/Facets/HopFacet.sol#L131)

Fix typo.

## [N-03] Implementation of `startBridgeTokensViaCBridge` has same functionality but deviates from conventions set in `startBridgeTokensViaHop` and `startBridgeTokensViaNXT`

[L57-84](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance/blob/main/src/Facets/CBridgeFacet.sol#L57-L84)<br>
[L61-72](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-03-lifinance/blob/main/src/Facets/HopFacet.sol#L61-L72)<br>

By comparing `startBridgeTokensViaCBridge` to `startBridgeTokensViaHop` and `startBridgeTokensViaNXT` we can see that the first deviates from the other two, despite containing the same functionality. This hurts readbility. Please implement `startBridgeTokensViaCBridge` in the same manner the other `startBridge` functions have been implemented. Differences can be seen below.

`startBridgeTokensViaCBridge`:

    function startBridgeTokensViaCBridge(LiFiData memory _lifiData, CBridgeData calldata _cBridgeData) public payable {
            if (_cBridgeData.token != address(0)) {
                uint256 _fromTokenBalance = LibAsset.getOwnBalance(_cBridgeData.token);

                LibAsset.transferFromERC20(_cBridgeData.token, msg.sender, address(this), _cBridgeData.amount);

                require(
                    LibAsset.getOwnBalance(_cBridgeData.token) - _fromTokenBalance == _cBridgeData.amount,
                    "ERR_INVALID_AMOUNT"
                );
            } else {
                require(msg.value >= _cBridgeData.amount, "ERR_INVALID_AMOUNT");
            }

`startBridgeTokensViaHop`:

            else {
                uint256 _sendingAssetIdBalance = LibAsset.getOwnBalance(sendingAssetId);
                LibAsset.transferFromERC20(sendingAssetId, msg.sender, address(this), _hopData.amount);
                require(

                    "ERR_INVALID_AMOUNT"
                );
            }

## [G-01] Storage: Help the optimizer by declaring a storage variable instead of repeatedly fetching a value in storage (for reading and writing)

To help the optimizer, declare a `storage` type variable and use it instead of repeatedly fetching the value in a map or an array.

The effect can be quite significant.

Instances include (check the `@audit` tags):

```solidity
src/Facets/DexManagerFacet.sol:
  20:         if (s.dexWhitelist[_dex] == true) { //@audit gas: fetch 1 for "s.dexWhitelist[_dexs]" (help the optimizer by storing this in a storage variable)
  24:         s.dexWhitelist[_dex] = true; //@audit gas: fetch 2 for "s.dexWhitelist[_dex]" (help the optimizer by using the previously suggested storage variable for this SSTORE)

  34:             if (s.dexWhitelist[_dexs[i]] == true) { //@audit gas: fetch 1 for "s.dexWhitelist[_dexs[i]]" (help the optimizer by storing this in a storage variable)
  37:             s.dexWhitelist[_dexs[i]] = true; //@audit gas: fetch 2 for "s.dexWhitelist[_dexs[i]]" (help the optimizer by using the previously suggested storage variable for this SSTORE)

  47:         if (s.dexWhitelist[_dex] == false) { //@audit gas: fetch 1 for "s.dexWhitelist[_dexs]" (help the optimizer by storing this in a storage variable)
  51:         s.dexWhitelist[_dex] = false; //@audit gas: fetch 2 for "s.dexWhitelist[_dex]" (help the optimizer by using the previously suggested storage variable for this SSTORE)
  
  66:             if (s.dexWhitelist[_dexs[i]] == false) { //@audit gas: fetch 1 for "s.dexWhitelist[_dexs[i]]" (help the optimizer by storing this in a storage variable)
  69:             s.dexWhitelist[_dexs[i]] = false; //@audit gas: fetch 2 for "s.dexWhitelist[_dexs[i]]" (help the optimizer by using the previously suggested storage variable for this SSTORE)
```

## [G-02] Storage: Emitting storage values

Here, the values emitted shouldn't be read from storage. The existing memory values should be used instead:

```solidity
src/Facets/CBridgeFacet.sol:
  45          s.cBridge = _cBridge;
  46          s.cBridgeChainId = _chainId;
  47:         emit Inited(s.cBridge, s.cBridgeChainId); //@audit gas: should emit Inited(_cBridge, _chainId)
```

## [G-03] Variables: No need to explicitly initialize variables with default values

If a variable is not set/initialized, it is assumed to have the default value (`0` for `uint`, `false` for `bool`, `address(0)` for address...). Explicitly initializing it with its default value is an anti-pattern and wastes gas.

Instances include:

```solidity
Facets/WithdrawFacet.sol:10:    address private constant NATIVE_ASSET = address(0);
Libraries/LibAsset.sol:21:    address internal constant NATIVE_ASSETID = address(0);
```

I suggest removing explicit initializations for default values.

## [G-04] Variables: "constants" expressions are expressions, not constants

Due to how `constant` variables are implemented (replacements at compile-time), an expression assigned to a `constant` variable is recomputed each time that the variable is used, which wastes some gas.

If the variable was `immutable` instead: the calculation would only be done once at deploy time (in the constructor), and then the result would be saved and read directly at runtime rather than being recalculated.

See: [ethereum/solidity#9232](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/9232)

> Consequences: each usage of a "constant" costs \~100gas more on each access (it is still a little better than storing the result in storage, but not much..). since these are not real constants, they can't be referenced from a real constant environment (e.g. from assembly, or from another library )

```solidity
Facets/CBridgeFacet.sol:18:    bytes32 internal constant NAMESPACE = keccak256("com.lifi.facets.cbridge2");
Facets/HopFacet.sol:18:    bytes32 internal constant NAMESPACE = keccak256("com.lifi.facets.hop");
Facets/NXTPFacet.sol:18:    bytes32 internal constant NAMESPACE = keccak256("com.lifi.facets.nxtp");
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:7:    bytes32 internal constant DIAMOND_STORAGE_POSITION = keccak256("diamond.standard.diamond.storage");
```

Change these expressions from `constant` to `immutable` and implement the calculation in the constructor or hardcode these values in the constants and add a comment to say how the value was calculated.

## [G-05] Comparisons: Boolean comparisons

Comparing to a constant (`true` or `false`) is a bit more expensive than directly checking the returned boolean value.
I suggest using `if(directValue)` instead of `if(directValue == true)` and `if(!directValue)` instead of `if(directValue == false)` here:

```solidity
Facets/DexManagerFacet.sol:20:        if (s.dexWhitelist[_dex] == true) {
Facets/DexManagerFacet.sol:34:            if (s.dexWhitelist[_dexs[i]] == true) {
Facets/DexManagerFacet.sol:47:        if (s.dexWhitelist[_dex] == false) {
Facets/DexManagerFacet.sol:66:            if (s.dexWhitelist[_dexs[i]] == false) {
Facets/Swapper.sol:16:                ls.dexWhitelist[_swapData[i].approveTo] == true && ls.dexWhitelist[_swapData[i].callTo] == true,
```

## [G-06] Comparisons: `> 0` is less efficient than `!= 0` for unsigned integers (with proof)

`!= 0` costs less gas compared to `> 0` for unsigned integers in `require` statements with the optimizer enabled (6 gas)

Proof: While it may seem that `> 0` is cheaper than `!=`, this is only true without the optimizer enabled and outside a require statement. If you enable the optimizer at 10k AND you're in a `require` statement, this will save gas. You can see this tweet for more proofs: <https://twitter.com/gzeon/status/1485428085885640706>

I suggest changing `> 0` with `!= 0` here:

```solidity
Facets/AnyswapFacet.sol:92:            require(_postSwapBalance > 0, "ERR_INVALID_AMOUNT");
Facets/AnyswapFacet.sol:105:            require(_postSwapBalance > 0, "ERR_INVALID_AMOUNT");
Facets/CBridgeFacet.sol:105:            require(_postSwapBalance > 0, "ERR_INVALID_AMOUNT");
Facets/CBridgeFacet.sol:116:            require(_postSwapBalance > 0, "ERR_INVALID_AMOUNT");
Facets/HopFacet.sol:109:        require(_postSwapBalance > 0, "ERR_INVALID_AMOUNT");
Facets/NXTPFacet.sol:98:        require(_postSwapBalance > 0, "ERR_INVALID_AMOUNT");
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:84:        require(_functionSelectors.length > 0, "LibDiamondCut: No selectors in facet to cut");
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:102:        require(_functionSelectors.length > 0, "LibDiamondCut: No selectors in facet to cut");
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:121:        require(_functionSelectors.length > 0, "LibDiamondCut: No selectors in facet to cut");
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:189:            require(_calldata.length > 0, "LibDiamondCut: _calldata is empty but _init is not address(0)");
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:212:        require(contractSize > 0, _errorMessage);
```

Also, please enable the Optimizer.

## [G-07] For-Loops: An array's length should be cached to save gas in for-loops

Reading array length at each iteration of the loop takes 6 gas (3 for mload and 3 to place memory_offset) in the stack.

Caching the array length in the stack saves around 3 gas per iteration.

Here, I suggest storing the array's length in a variable before the for-loop, and use it instead:

```solidity
Facets/DexManagerFacet.sol:33:        for (uint256 i; i < _dexs.length; i++) {
Facets/DexManagerFacet.sol:52:        for (uint256 i; i < s.dexs.length; i++) {
Facets/DexManagerFacet.sol:65:        for (uint256 i; i < _dexs.length; i++) {
Facets/DexManagerFacet.sol:70:            for (uint256 j; j < s.dexs.length; j++) {
Facets/HopFacet.sol:48:        for (uint8 i; i < _tokens.length; i++) {
Facets/Swapper.sol:14:        for (uint8 i; i < _swapData.length; i++) {
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:67:        for (uint256 facetIndex; facetIndex < _diamondCut.length; facetIndex++) {
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:92:        for (uint256 selectorIndex; selectorIndex < _functionSelectors.length; selectorIndex++) {
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:110:        for (uint256 selectorIndex; selectorIndex < _functionSelectors.length; selectorIndex++) {
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:125:        for (uint256 selectorIndex; selectorIndex < _functionSelectors.length; selectorIndex++) {
```

This is already done here:

```jsx
Facets/DiamondLoupeFacet.sol:24:        for (uint256 i; i < numFacets; i++) {
```

## [G-08] For-Loops: `++i` costs less gas compared to `i++`

`++i` costs less gas compared to `i++` for unsigned integer, as pre-increment is cheaper (about 5 gas per iteration)

`i++` increments `i` and returns the initial value of `i`. Which means:

```solidity
uint i = 1;  
i++; // == 1 but i == 2  
```

But `++i` returns the actual incremented value:

```solidity
uint i = 1;  
++i; // == 2 and i == 2 too, so no need for a temporary variable  
```

In the first case, the compiler has to create a temporary variable (when used) for returning `1` instead of `2`

Instances include:

```solidity
Facets/DexManagerFacet.sol:33:        for (uint256 i; i < _dexs.length; i++) {
Facets/DexManagerFacet.sol:52:        for (uint256 i; i < s.dexs.length; i++) {
Facets/DexManagerFacet.sol:65:        for (uint256 i; i < _dexs.length; i++) {
Facets/DexManagerFacet.sol:70:            for (uint256 j; j < s.dexs.length; j++) {
Facets/DiamondLoupeFacet.sol:24:        for (uint256 i; i < numFacets; i++) {
Facets/HopFacet.sol:48:        for (uint8 i; i < _tokens.length; i++) {
Facets/Swapper.sol:14:        for (uint8 i; i < _swapData.length; i++) {
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:67:        for (uint256 facetIndex; facetIndex < _diamondCut.length; facetIndex++) {
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:92:        for (uint256 selectorIndex; selectorIndex < _functionSelectors.length; selectorIndex++) {
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:97:            selectorPosition++;
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:110:        for (uint256 selectorIndex; selectorIndex < _functionSelectors.length; selectorIndex++) {
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:116:            selectorPosition++;
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:125:        for (uint256 selectorIndex; selectorIndex < _functionSelectors.length; selectorIndex++) {
```

I suggest using `++i` instead of `i++` to increment the value of an uint variable.

## [G-09] For-Loops: Increments can be unchecked

In Solidity 0.8+, there's a default overflow check on unsigned integers. It's possible to uncheck this in for-loops and save some gas at each iteration, but at the cost of some code readability, as this uncheck cannot be made inline.

[ethereum/solidity#10695](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/10695)

Instances include:

```solidity
Facets/DexManagerFacet.sol:33:        for (uint256 i; i < _dexs.length; i++) {
Facets/DexManagerFacet.sol:52:        for (uint256 i; i < s.dexs.length; i++) {
Facets/DexManagerFacet.sol:65:        for (uint256 i; i < _dexs.length; i++) {
Facets/DexManagerFacet.sol:70:            for (uint256 j; j < s.dexs.length; j++) {
Facets/DiamondLoupeFacet.sol:24:        for (uint256 i; i < numFacets; i++) {
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:67:        for (uint256 facetIndex; facetIndex < _diamondCut.length; facetIndex++) {
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:92:        for (uint256 selectorIndex; selectorIndex < _functionSelectors.length; selectorIndex++) {
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:97:            selectorPosition++;
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:110:        for (uint256 selectorIndex; selectorIndex < _functionSelectors.length; selectorIndex++) {
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:116:            selectorPosition++;
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:125:        for (uint256 selectorIndex; selectorIndex < _functionSelectors.length; selectorIndex++) {
```

The code would go from:

```solidity
for (uint256 i; i < numIterations; i++) {  
 // ...  
}  
```

to:

```solidity
for (uint256 i; i < numIterations;) {  
 // ...  
 unchecked { ++i; }  
}  
```

I suggest not unchecking the increments at these places as the risk of overflow is existent for `uint8` there:

```solidity
Facets/HopFacet.sol:48:        for (uint8 i; i < _tokens.length; i++) {
Facets/Swapper.sol:14:        for (uint8 i; i < _swapData.length; i++) {
```

## [G-10] Arithmetics: `unchecked` blocks for arithmetics operations that can't underflow/overflow

Solidity version 0.8+ comes with implicit overflow and underflow checks on unsigned integers. When an overflow or an underflow isn't possible (as an example, when a comparison is made before the arithmetic operation, or the operation doesn't depend on user input), some gas can be saved by using an `unchecked` block: [Checked or Unchecked Arithmetic](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.10/control-structures.html#checked-or-unchecked-arithmetic).<br>

I suggest wrapping with an `unchecked` block here (see `@audit` tags for more details):

```solidity
src/Facets/AnyswapFacet.sol:
   46:                 LibAsset.getOwnBalance(underlyingToken) - _fromTokenBalance == _anyswapData.amount, //@audit gas: should be unchecked (can't underflow)
   90:             uint256 _postSwapBalance = LibAsset.getOwnBalance(underlyingToken) - _fromTokenBalance;  //@audit gas: should be unchecked (can't underflow)
  101:             require(address(this).balance - _fromBalance >= _anyswapData.amount, "ERR_INVALID_AMOUNT");  //@audit gas: should be unchecked (can't underflow)
  103:             uint256 _postSwapBalance = address(this).balance - _fromBalance;  //@audit gas: should be unchecked (can't underflow)

src/Facets/CBridgeFacet.sol:
   64:                 LibAsset.getOwnBalance(_cBridgeData.token) - _fromTokenBalance == _cBridgeData.amount,  //@audit gas: should be unchecked (can't underflow)
  103:             uint256 _postSwapBalance = LibAsset.getOwnBalance(_cBridgeData.token) - _fromTokenBalance;  //@audit gas: should be unchecked (can't underflow)
  114:             uint256 _postSwapBalance = address(this).balance - _fromBalance;  //@audit gas: should be unchecked (can't underflow)

src/Facets/DexManagerFacet.sol:
  85:         s.dexs[index] = s.dexs[s.dexs.length - 1];  //@audit gas: should be unchecked (used in a for-loop that wouldn't call this function if "s.dexs.length == 0")

src/Facets/GenericSwapFacet.sol:
  28:         uint256 postSwapBalance = LibAsset.getOwnBalance(_lifiData.receivingAssetId) - receivingAssetIdBalance;  //@audit gas: should be unchecked (can't underflow)

src/Facets/HopFacet.sol:
   69:                 LibAsset.getOwnBalance(sendingAssetId) - _sendingAssetIdBalance == _hopData.amount,  //@audit gas: should be unchecked (can't underflow)
  107:         uint256 _postSwapBalance = LibAsset.getOwnBalance(sendingAssetId) - _sendingAssetIdBalance;  //@audit gas: should be unchecked (can't underflow)

src/Facets/NXTPFacet.sol:
   57:                 LibAsset.getOwnBalance(sendingAssetId) - _sendingAssetIdBalance == _nxtpData.amount,  //@audit gas: should be unchecked (can't underflow)
   96:         uint256 _postSwapBalance = LibAsset.getOwnBalance(sendingAssetId) - _sendingAssetIdBalance;  //@audit gas: should be unchecked (can't underflow)
  165:         if (postSwapBalance > startingBalance) {
  166:             finalBalance = postSwapBalance - startingBalance;  //@audit gas: should be unchecked (see L165)

src/Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:
  159:         uint256 lastSelectorPosition = ds.facetFunctionSelectors[_facetAddress].functionSelectors.length - 1; //@audit gas: should be unchecked (only called inside for-loops of length > 0)

  48:         toAmount = LibAsset.getOwnBalance(_swapData.receivingAssetId) - toAmount; //@audit gas: should be unchecked (can't underflow)

  12:         bytes memory revertData = _res.slice(4, _res.length - 4); // Remove the selector which is the first 4 bytes //@audit gas: should be unchecked (see L11)
```

## [G-11] Visibility: Public functions to external

The following functions could be set external to save gas and improve code quality.
External call cost is less expensive than of public functions.

```solidity
 - AnyswapFacet.startBridgeTokensViaAnyswap(ILiFi.LiFiData,AnyswapFacet.AnyswapData) (src/Facets/AnyswapFacet.sol#35-66)
 - CBridgeFacet.startBridgeTokensViaCBridge(ILiFi.LiFiData,CBridgeFacet.CBridgeData) (src/Facets/CBridgeFacet.sol#57-84)

 - WithdrawFacet.withdraw(address,address,uint256) (src/Facets/WithdrawFacet.sol#20-38)
```

## [G-12] Errors: Reduce the size of error messages (Long revert Strings)

Shortening revert strings to fit in 32 bytes will decrease deployment time gas and will decrease runtime gas when the revert condition is met.

Revert strings that are longer than 32 bytes require at least one additional mstore, along with additional overhead for computing memory offset, etc.

Revert strings > 32 bytes:

```solidity
Facets/AnyswapFacet.sol:133:        require(block.chainid != _anyswapData.toChainId, "Cannot bridge to the same network.");
Facets/CBridgeFacet.sol:147:        require(s.cBridgeChainId != _cBridgeData.dstChainId, "Cannot bridge to the same network.");
Facets/HopFacet.sol:146:        require(s.hopChainId != _hopData.chainId, "Cannot bridge to the same network.");
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:56:        require(msg.sender == diamondStorage().contractOwner, "LibDiamond: Must be contract owner");
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:76:                revert("LibDiamondCut: Incorrect FacetCutAction");
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:84:        require(_functionSelectors.length > 0, "LibDiamondCut: No selectors in facet to cut");
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:86:        require(_facetAddress != address(0), "LibDiamondCut: Add facet can't be address(0)");
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:95:            require(oldFacetAddress == address(0), "LibDiamondCut: Can't add function that already exists");
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:102:        require(_functionSelectors.length > 0, "LibDiamondCut: No selectors in facet to cut");
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:104:        require(_facetAddress != address(0), "LibDiamondCut: Add facet can't be address(0)");
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:113:            require(oldFacetAddress != _facetAddress, "LibDiamondCut: Can't replace function with same function");
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:121:        require(_functionSelectors.length > 0, "LibDiamondCut: No selectors in facet to cut");
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:124:        require(_facetAddress == address(0), "LibDiamondCut: Remove facet address must be address(0)");
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:133:        enforceHasContractCode(_facetAddress, "LibDiamondCut: New facet has no code");
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:154:        require(_facetAddress != address(0), "LibDiamondCut: Can't remove function that doesn't exist");
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:156:        require(_facetAddress != address(this), "LibDiamondCut: Can't remove immutable function");
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:187:            require(_calldata.length == 0, "LibDiamondCut: _init is address(0) but_calldata is not empty");
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:189:            require(_calldata.length > 0, "LibDiamondCut: _calldata is empty but _init is not address(0)");
Libraries/LibDiamond.sol:200:                    revert("LibDiamondCut: _init function reverted"); 
```

I suggest shortening the revert strings to fit in 32 bytes, or that using custom errors as described next.

## [G-13] Errors: Use Custom Errors instead of Revert Strings to save Gas

Custom errors from Solidity 0.8.4 are cheaper than revert strings (cheaper deployment cost and runtime cost when the revert condition is met)

Source: [Custom Errors in Solidity](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/):

> Starting from [Solidity v0.8.4](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.4), there is a convenient and gas-efficient way to explain to users why an operation failed through the use of custom errors. Until now, you could already use strings to give more information about failures (e.g., `revert("Insufficient funds.");`), but they are rather expensive, especially when it comes to deploy cost, and it is difficult to use dynamic information in them.

Custom errors are defined using the `error` statement, which can be used inside and outside of contracts (including interfaces and libraries).

I suggest replacing revert strings with custom errors.
