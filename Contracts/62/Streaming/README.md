**Template repository for getting started quickly with DappTools**

![Github Actions](https://github.com/gakonst/dapptools-template/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)

## Building and testing

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gakonst/dapptools-template
cd dapptools-template
make # This installs the project's dependencies.
make test
```

## Deploying

Contracts can be deployed via the `make deploy` command. Addresses are automatically
written in a name-address json file stored under `out/addresses.json`.

We recommend testing your deployments and provide an example under [`scripts/test-deploy.sh`](./scripts/test-deploy.sh)
which will launch a local testnet, deploy the contracts, and do some sanity checks.

Environment variables under the `.env` file are automatically loaded (see [`.env.example`](./.env.example)).
Be careful of the [precedence in which env vars are read](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools/tree/2cf441052489625f8635bc69eb4842f0124f08e4/src/dapp#precedence).

We assume `ETH_FROM` is an address you own and is part of your keystore.
If not, use `ethsign import` to import your private key.

See the [`Makefile`](./Makefile#25) for more context on how this works under the hood

We use Alchemy as a remote node provider for the Mainnet & Rinkeby network deployments.
You must have set your API key as the `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` enviroment variable in order to
deploy to these networks

### Mainnet

```
ETH_FROM=0x3538b6eF447f244268BCb2A0E1796fEE7c45002D make deploy-mainnet
```

### Rinkeby

```
ETH_FROM=0x3538b6eF447f244268BCb2A0E1796fEE7c45002D make deploy-rinkeby
```

### Custom Network

```
ETH_RPC_URL=<your network> make deploy
```

### Local Testnet

```
# on one terminal
dapp testnet
# get the printed account address from the testnet, and set it as ETH_FROM. Then:
make deploy
```

### Verifying on Etherscan

After deploying your contract you can verify it on Etherscan using:

```
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=<api-key> contract_address=<address> network_name=<mainnet|rinkeby|...> make verify
```

Check out the [dapp documentation](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools/tree/master/src/dapp#dapp-verify-contract) to see how
verifying contracts work with DappTools.

## Installing the toolkit

If you do not have DappTools already installed, you'll need to run the below
commands

### Install Nix

```sh
# User must be in sudoers
curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh

# Run this or login again to use Nix
. "$HOME/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh"
```

### Install DappTools

```sh
curl https://dapp.tools/install | sh
```
