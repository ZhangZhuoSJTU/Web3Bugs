This project aims to provide a valuable resource for Web3 developers and security analysts by facilitating their understanding of exploitable bugs in smart contracts. We conduct a thorough analysis of exploitable bugs extracted from [code4rena](https://code4rena.com/) and classify each bug according to its nature.

Our initial research suggests that a notable proportion of exploitable bugs in smart contracts are functional bugs, which cannot be detected using simple and general oracles like reentrancy. We aim to raise awareness about the significance of such bugs and encourage practitioners to develop more sophisticated and nuanced automatic semantical oracles to detect them.

Please be aware that __this repository is currently undergoing active development, and the data may change over time due to ongoing code4rena contests__.

## Dataset Description

### Folder Structure

The dataset is organized into four folders:

+ [papers/](papers/): contains our ICSE23 paper summarizing our preliminary results, as well as the supplementary material for the paper.
+ [results/](results/): contains the bug classification in [bugs.csv](results/bugs.csv) and the description for each contest in [contests.csv](results/contests.csv).
+ [contracts/](contracts/): contains all the smart contracts that we examined, using the version at the time of the contest.
+ [reports/](reports/): contains all the reports provided by code4rena.

### Bug Labels

We classify the surveyed bugs into three main categories based on their nature: 

+ Out-of-scope bugs (denoted by __O__)
+ Bugs with simple and general testing oracles (denoted by __L__)
+ Bugs that require high-level semantical oracles (denoted by __S__)

As classifying functional bugs can be ambiguous, we welcome suggestions to improve our classification standards. You can find more detailed label information in our [documentation](docs/standard.md), and we encourage you to refer to our current classification [guidelines](docs/standard.md#process) for more information.

## Recommended Security Analysis Tools

Our goal is to create a comprehensive list of vulnerability detection techniques that will be a valuable resource for Web3 developers and security analysts. We will focus on two main categories:

+ Vulnerability detection techniques that prioritize the development of semantical oracles for smart contracts.
+ Publicly available security analysis tools that can be used for auditing

<span style="color:red"><strong>We warmly welcome any additional suggestions or contributions from the community to help expand and improve the list. </strong></span> 

### Vulnerability Detection with Automatic Semantical Oracles

We believe that future web3 security efforts will prioritize identifying functional bugs and developing corresponding oracles. To this end, we intend to compile a list of techniques that provide guidance in the creation of automatic semantic oracles. These techniques will be sourced from various materials, such as peer-reviewed research papers, pre-prints, industry tools, and online resources.

| Technique                                                                                                                                          | Bug Category   |

### Publicly Available Security Analysis Techniques

This section will include open-source techniques that are publicly available and currently in active development. These techniques can be used either directly by Web3 developers and security analysts or as building blocks for other tools. We give priority to source-code level techniques, which are better suited for Web3 development and auditing contexts.
